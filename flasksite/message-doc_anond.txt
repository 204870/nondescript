told me because the place is holding the vehicle, ain't a lot the men can do. read: pay them what they desire, subsequently attempt to get it back. well, when i don't have the cash in the first place, how the heck do you advise i do that? the proposition was made (i won't acknowledge by whom) to find the spare key and zoom off with the auto. as raging as i am, i do not want a felony appended to my woes. my design now (and it changes every few minutes) is to get down to there, inquire for the vehicle, and tell the people to charge the fix to the petro-can card. and drive off very quickly. because it'll get turned down. i said $300 was all one was paying for a real good reason - it was everything i had left on my petro-canada card. which would put me $3000 in sum in debt for an automobile that i could only potentially sell for that much. potentially being the emphasized word. i don't really know for sure so far that it's going to work when i take it back. knowing my fortune, and the track record with the workshop, i'll likely get it again and it'll be broken once more. but subsequently, just long enough for them to be able to announce "well, it was working when we test-drove it." maybe i should call in to the cops and say it's stolen .
