said because the shop is holding my car, there isn't much they can do. Read: pay them what they want, and then fight to get it back. Well, when I don't have the money in the first place, how the hell do you propose I do that? The suggestion was made (I won't mention by whom) to find the spare key and simply drive off with the car. As angry as I am, I do not want a criminal charge added to my woes. My plan at the moment (and it changes every few minutes) is to drive down there, ask for my car, and tell them to charge the repairs to my Petro-Can card. And drive off fast. Because it'll get declined. I said $300 was all I was paying for a very good reason - it was how much room I had left on my Petro-Canada card. Which would put me $3000 total in the hole for a car that I could only hopefully sell for that much. Hopefully being the operative word. I don't even know for sure yet that it's going to run once I take it home. Knowing my luck, and the track record with the shop, I'll probably get it home and it'll be clunking again. But after just long enough for them to be able to say "Well, it was working when we test-drove it." Maybe I should call in to the police and say it's stolen .
