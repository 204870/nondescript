100 Things About Me . . . Inspired by the blogs I've been reading lately: 1. I have my very first brand new car (a 2003 blue Honda Civic coupe). . . duh! =) 2. I wish I had more doodads at home . . . a digital camera would be cool! 3. I have 2 black cats, Tigger and Jazz. Tigger is a snob, Jazz is a pig. But I love them both. 4. I have 3 younger brothers, and we're all almost exactly 2 years apart. Who says the rhythm method doesn't work? =) 5. I enjoy my job as a petroleum technologist. 6. I wish I could have the best of both worlds, and get paid for learning instead of the other way around. 7. I once had a hamster named Webster. He died of asthma, or at least died wheezing. 8. I once had a hamster named Fluffy. She died of a tumor. Hamsters aren't very good pets. =( 9. I lived on West Timor Island, Indonesia for 8 months when I was 15 (with my family, of course). 10. I was in French immersion until grade 7. 11. I was incredibly shy as a child, and still am with strangers. 12. I never had an imaginary friend. 13. I wanted to be a vet when I was younger. 14. I also wanted to be an astronaut . . . 15. I wanted to be a geneticist when I was in high school. OK, that's a 100-list in itself . . . =) 16. I hate wearing glasses, and wear contacts unless I absolutely physically cannot (like this week). 17. My parents are divorced, and one is remarried. 18. I never want to get divorced. 19. I was engaged shortly before 20, unengaged shortly after 21. 20. I love sleeping in. 21. Summer is my favorite season, and I hate having to work through it. 22. I hated being unemployed this past summer (go figure *L*). 23. I hate waiting. 24. I have all 10 fingers and toes. 25. If my mum gets remarried to someone with a last name that starts with a C, her initials will be ABC. 26. I love to swim. 27. If I have children, they'll learn to swim before they walk. 28. I set several provincial swimming records when I was younger. 29. Most have been broken by now. What the hell do they feed kids these days?! 30. I have strawberry blonde hair, and always wish it was redder. 31. My grandpa always compliments my hair. I love my grandpa. =) 32. I love sincere compliments that come out of the blue. 33. I once had a cruch on Jonathan Brandis when I was in junior high. 34. I am convinced that I had an online fling with Ethan Embry, though some part of me will always wonder if it really was him, or some sap with too much time on his hands. 35. I used to be a net addict. 36. I'm not a cyber-virgin, but it's not something I'd do again. It's actually kind of sad. 37. I prefer the real thing. =) 38. I would eventually like to be a member of the Mile High club. Just to say I did it. 39. I like my coffee from Tim Hortons, with 2 cream and one sugar. 40. I usually add another sugar cube when I get to work. 41. I once ran away from home. I honestly thought it would be one less thing for my parents to worry about if I wasn't around. I think I was 13 or 14. 42. My father doesn't talk to me anymore (unrelated to 41, as far as I know). 43. I have moved 6 times since I was 18, and am about to move twice more in the next couple of months. 44. I don't like moving. 45. I find routines reassuring and stifling all at once. =) 46. I don't fix into a box (figuratively . . . I could, literally, if it was big enough). 47. I like to know the big picture before I'm told details or individual steps. 48. I think Sean Connery was and will always be the best James Bond. 49. I think Vin Diesel is pretty awesome eye candy. 50. My hair almost reached my butt when I was 8 years old. 51. I sometimes miss how my mum used to brush my hair and play with it when I was young. 52. Sometimes I'm glad I never had a sister. 53. Sometimes I'm sad that I never had a sister. 54. I know that "baca" means both "read" and "boyfriend" in Indonesian. 55. I love filtered/bottled water. Tap water tastes funny. 56. I still eat KD. 57. I still eat PB&J sandwiches from time to time (today, actually!) 58. I am not terribly good at keeping friends. There are many from my childhood that I wish I had kept in touch with. 59. My very first boyfriend's name was Peter. We grossed everyone out by holding hands on the school bus. I was in grade 3. 60. I never kissed a boy until the summer after I graduated high school. 61. I was no longer a virgin less than a year later. 62. I can count on one hand the number of men I've "been with". Just so you don't get the wrong impression. =) 63. I try not to judge people by their covers. 64. I would be lost without post-it notes . . . the saying "You'd forget your head at home in the morning if it wasn't attached" is quite accurate with me. 65. My parents always said "buggy" instead of shopping cart. So do I. People think I'm weird. I think it's different. And different is good. 66. I don't call it a boot (trunk), lift (elevator), or trousers (pants) . . . but I love Bristol-speak. 67. I have cool cousins over in England, but I've only met 2 of them (and an aunt and uncle). 68. I want to travel more. 69. Apart from never having money, I loved being a student. 70. I like having money - enough to be comfortable. But really, is there ever "enough" for the average person? 71. I am sometimes guilty of seeing material possessions as a sign of success and status. 72. I love my boyfriend. 73. I love my family. 74. I don't see my family often enough, especially my Papa. 75. I have never heard my Papa say a single bad thing about my Nana. He comes just shy of worshipping her and her memory . . . I wish more couples were like that these days. 76. I was baptized Roman Catholic as a baby. 77. I don't go to church . . . sadly, not even on special occasions. 78. I do not look highly on "holiday worshippers" who call themselves religious people. 79. My favorite colors are blue and dark green. 80. I hate yellow, period. Unless it's a sunny day. That's the only thing that should be yellow. 81. I am pro-choice. I don't think other people should have the right to tell a person what to do with his/her life. 82. I do not enjoy answering the phone at work. At home is a different story. 83. I get frustrated when I don't know the answer to a question. 84. I can be very impatient sometimes (no kidding - I couldn't wait a week for my car!) 85. I think the 80s was a great time to be growing up. Kids these days grow up way too fast. 86. I think cloning humans is immoral and just a bad idea in general. Nothing good could come of it. 87. I believe in guardian angels - my Nana and Uncle Aidan keep very busy looking out for my family and I. 88. I don't disbelieve in ghosts, reincarnation, and aliens. 89. I believe there is a God, but that's about as detailed as I'm often willing to go about my religious beliefs. Give me a drink or two, and that might change though. =) 90. I think most people are essentially good, but there are always bad seeds. 91. I believe evil does exist. How can you have one without the other? =) 92. I love writing for personal use - journals, blogs, etc. Otherwise, I'm not terribly creative. 93. I have been told I have excellent technical writing skills. 94. I used to play and teach the piano. I hope to re-acquaint myself with it again one day. 95. I'm an excellent speller. I wish we had spelling bees and competitions when I was in grade school. 96. My mum once had to speed from a swimming competition in one city to a musical awards ceremony in our hometown so I could attend both events. I was barely 10 years old, and at the top of my game. =) 97. I can do anything I put my mind to - the trick is sticking with it. =) 98. I love going to the gym and working out, but I also love my "down time". 99. I believe people are only victims if they allow themselves to be. 100. I think it's time to go home now! =) Awww . . . Christmas season is over, and NOW the snow comes! That was awfully disappointing - not getting a white Christmas. Add that in with the late (and sparse) shopping and no decorations at home . . . it just didn't quite feel much like Christmas this year. Well, there's always next year to look forward to. =) And now it's back to the grind. Sort of. One full day today, a half day tomorrow, then Wednesday will be spent nursing a hangover, I'm sure . . . and back to work again on Thursday and Friday. The most frustrating part is I have work that needs to get done, but I can't do much without getting information from other people, and they're all off on holidays! Not to mention that I've been expected to handle all the phone calls for the last week (and this week), and well as keep track of who's here and who's not (for the purpose of transferring calls, as not everyone has their voice mail set up). Sometimes I wonder how we actually make money, things are so disorganized around here . . . =) But enough about work . . . I'm going to babble about my car now! =) Yes, I finally got it. I was immensely disappointed when I realized I wouldn't get it in time for Christmas. But no worries - the time passed by quickly enough. The day I went to pick it up was so busy! It took an hour and a half to get all the paperwork straight and finally drive away. Then I had to drop off the car I'd been borrowing for the last 2 weeks, which was almost across the city. Since I wasn't comfortable driving in traffic (OK, driving at all), my boyfriend had the pleasure of being its first driver. And he was quite impressed . . . it's only a little 115-hp Civic engine , but it's pretty peppy. And decently roomy, too. =) So on with the story . . . You'll remember (or did I mention it?) that I bought a 5-speed when all I've ever driven is an automatic. I've always wanted to know how to drive one, and I figured this would be a good way to force me to learn. Yes, I'm warped. =) Anyways, I decided I was more comfortable practicing in the neighbourhood around his place, since it was more familiar. So we drove back across the city and spent the next hour or so with me creeping around and trying to avoid traffic. =) The few times someone came up behind me, or that I was faced with traffic when turning, I'd panic. Especially with someone behind me. I was still very slow at starting from a dead stop, which meant if there was any sort of slope to the road, I'd be rolling backwards until I got going. But it didn't take me long to feel where the clutch engaged (or is it disengaged?), so I got a little quicker at that. After a couple of missteps, I decided I needed a break to try and steady my nerves. Sadly, I never went out again because we had places to go and I still didn't want to drive in regular traffic. Then Sunday rolled around, with it's foot of fresh snow. I was happy about finally getting snow, but not that I'd have to worry about winter driving on top of still learning to drive a stick. So my boyfriend drove us around town again. =) Went to see Lord of the Rings . . . good movie. I couldn't believe how packed the theatre was, considering it was 11:30 on a Sunday morning, and there'd been a foot of snow. But we got there early enough, and it was a pretty good movie. After all was said and done, I didn't do any more driving, which made me a little nervous, since I'd be driving myself to work the next morning. Well, as you can tell, I obviously made it to work in one piece. =) Only one stall (after I nearly rear-ended someone - yikes!), from which I recovered quite nicely. I won't mention that the drive to work is barely 5km. =) I had jello legs by the time I got to work, but I'm here. =) I think at lunch, I'm going to make the trip to and from again, just to get in the practice. Ohhhh . . . too many people are calling this morning! Now there's just New Years', and then the most-hyped holiday season of the year will be over. That's OK though, cuz there will be plenty for me to look forward to in the new year . . . =) I hope everyone had a wonderful Christmas! =) I know it's been my best one in quite a few years . . . Busy though! My boyfriend has a huge family compared to mine, and they're all quite close. So the first stop on Christmas Eve was his father's. After a couple hours of noshing and visiting and opening a few presents (I couldn't believe there were two for me there!), it was off to one of his aunt's for more noshing and visiting. It was actually a good thing that there wasn't an entire meal at either stop. I don't think I would have made it home without exploding if there was! =) But it was great visiting with so many people. Christmas morning saw us back at his aunt's for breakfast - but not before opening our stockings for each other. =) After breakfast was a visit with his mum and more presents! And finally it was time to visit my family. Luckily, they were all gathered at my mum's, so it only involved one stop. =) I was frantically wrapping presents at the last minute, and even attaching name cards after I got there. So there was yet another round of presents. I got so many cool things this year, and things I really want & need! I'm so lucky . . . I also got to see my grandpa and aunt and uncle, whom I love to see, but rarely make the effort to visit during the year. I just can't wait until next year. I'm determined that next year I'll be able to do more Christmas shopping, and have the time and/or resources to help out those less fortunate as well. I have fond memories from my teenage years of taking home paper angels from the Christmas tree at Church, and buying gifts for the people on the angel. I also had great fun "shopping" in the church hall, filling boxes according to family size for those would have a hard time feeding themselves and their children over the holidays. Whenever I'm tempted to think I'm having a rough time, I remember doing those things, and the unspeakable gratitude in the eyes of the people who received something as simple as a box full of food. And suddenly I feel incredibly blessed. =) MERRY CHRISTMAS EVERYONE!! Finally, a productive weekend . . . Saturday finally saw me Christmas shopping at 9:30 in the morning. I'm glad I went early, even though it meant yet another weekend without sleeping in. The mall was empty for the most part, and I was done within an hour and a half. I'm sure I'll be doing a few last-minute things tonight or tomorrow, but that's OK - the most important stuff is done. And I bought a car on Saturday!!!! I don't actually have it yet, because it wasn't in stock. But hopefully before Christmas, at the latest within a week. I bought myself a trusty old Honda Civic. Well, not old - a 2003, to be exact. With some of the nicer doodads (power windows, CD player, keyless entry, A/C, etc), but not the fully loaded version. My boyfriend was actually very impressed with me - after a week of watching me take all the salesmen's pitches and crap and being spineless, he was quite shocked when I started pushing this last salesman around. =) I felt kinda bad, but after the week I had, I wasn't about to put up with anymore bull. I knew what I wanted, how much I wanted to pay for it, and that I wanted it ASAP. He'll be getting a very nice Christmas card from me. =) Sunday was Christmas brunch with a few friends. Good eats and good company. =) It was sad that a few people couldn't make it, but with it being so close to Christmas, that's to be expected. Everyone's got family obligations this time of year. I can't believe it's a New Year in just over a week . . . I know it'll hold some interesting (and hopefully good!) times . . . It has been a long week. I'm looking forward to the break over Christmas. So many big issues to deal with at once. Well, big for me, anyways. And the cars are only part of it. I read other peoples' blogs lately, and feel ashamed that something that is essentially a material issue has taken on such importance in my life. There are far worse things I could be dealing with. I'm looking forward to seeing my family over Christmas. Another thing I'm ashamed of - all my mum's family (except for an uncle I haven't seen since I was a child) lives in the same city as me. Two aunts and their husbands, and more recently, my grandpa. And apart from when my mum was in the hospital over the summer and at Christmas, I really don't see them at all. It's not that I can't stand them . . . I'd love to see them more often. I just don't make it a priority. Sometimes I can be a very selfish and self-centered person . . . Well, I'd better find a more cheery note on which to finish this entry . . . It's Friday! =) We're off at noon to have a little Christmas party, we're getting bonusses after all, which means I can actually afford to do my meager Christmas shopping after all. Everything else will work itself out. =) More car stories for today . . . Yesterday was the "big night". I went out in the evening with the intention of buying, and hopefully driving something new by the weekend. I was a tad sidetracked. At work, I was told that the company had fleet deals through a certain dealership, so I decided it wouldn't hurt to visit there first. Might as well see if fleet deals would get me a better price. An hour and a half later - and only a half hour before my original dealership would close - I left empty handed, frustrated, and confused. I will never deal with them again. The salesmen had tried to sell me a Pontiac when I wanted a Chevy, a GT (most expensive package, for those who aren't car-savvy) when I was pretty sure all I could afford was maybe an upgraded base model, and wouldn't talk numbers until I'd been there for an hour. I went in knowing what my price range was, and the first numbers he gave me were over $100 more. He wasted my time. So I sped back to my original Chevy dealership in the hopes that my salesman would still deal with me. He gave me a better deal without much/any haggling from me, and without me even mentioning "fleet pricing". He knew my price range, and while I'd decided I wanted more bells and whistles, was doing his best to accomodate what I wanted. Unfortunately, I didn't feel comfortable signing that night. I wanted the upgrade package, but wanted to double-check if I could afford it. So he offered to round up a base and an upgraded model for me the next day so I could physically see what it was I was buying, and could hopefully make a decision. He's guaranteed my business for years to come. And the business of my boyfriend, who said the guy was way more patient with me that he would have been. =) I tend to agree. Ohhh, late breaking news folks. I'm enjoying playing this game. =) I just got a call from the company dealership - they don't want to lose my business. I got asked what I was being offered at the other place, told that they'll beat that, and would I give them a chance? We'll see how this plays out over the course of the day. =) Anyways . . . I'm still in a battle over the broken car that started this whole fiasco. Today's project is to call BBB to find out what my rights are, or if I even have any, before I go ahead and start being pushy (me? pushy? that'll be interesting *L*). I feel like such a cheapskate lately. While I'm sure all of my bargaining lately is legit, it still makes me feel cheap. I'm trying to get money back on my broken car. I'm haggling over the price of a new car. I'm hoping (once it's properly fixed) to make a decent sum of money on my old car. I'm worried that pretty soon, out of habit, I'll start arguing with the cashier over the price of my groceries. *L* Hardly, but that's sure how I feel. And numbers. Ohhhh, numbers. They are constantly changing!! "$1700 to fix your car, ma'am" . . . "oops, the final bill's $1821" . . . "with a MSRP of $23895, we'll sell it to you for $23100, and that'll be a montly payment of $360 over 3 years" . . . "but I want four years" . . . "oh, and that doesn't include your grad rebate or our promotional offer" . . . "ok, so that's $308 now, but that's before GST" . . . AHHHHHHH!! After two hours of this last night, I was ready to scream. I'm glad I'm not in accounting . . . =) You know . . . wouldn't it be just peachy if, after all this stress, I called the Ring In & Win number and won my vehicle? With my luck, I have better chances of winning the lottery - and I don't buy lotto tickets. But you never know . . . I can't wait to have this whole thing over with. But each time I think I've finally made a decision, I talk to someone new, and they have their own advice. And it makes sense, but it gives me something more to think about, and it makes me re-consider my decision. This really isn't something I want to just jump into - this is a 3-5 year commitment. Oy vay . . . The ballots are in . . . a Cavalier it shall be. I had a realization last night . . . this is not a life-altering decision. I can change my mind again in a few years. It's just not worth being stressed out by the payments to get a car I think I really love. It's just a car, and it'll forever be an expense, not an asset (though I believe they can be used as collateral, but that's not a concern of mine right now). It made me feel immensely relieved to finally make this decision and have it validated by someone who's opinion matters to me. Not matter how many people may say I should have gone with such-and-such, it's my decision. That feels good. =) I've never been a terribly opinionated person. Major decisions often don't come easy to me. I can take both sides and argue both sides in an argument, and often don't have a strong position on any subject. That's changed lately, and I like it. =) Nobody likes a person with a weak spine, or no opinions of their own. Perhaps some people who are used to the 'aim-to-please' me may not be so impressed, but that's their problem! Tomorrow's the big day . . . I'm excited! =) Wow, an interesting weekend for once. =) By noon on Saturday , I was a basket case. I'd been to the Toyota dealership and test-driven a Matrix and a Corolla. The Matrix was definitely more attractive, but just enough more $$ than the sensible Corolla to cause me problems. I realized later in the afternoon why the lease payments were so much higher for the same selling price - Toyota has awful interest rates. So I decided to let everything marinate. Then I got ambitious in the afternoon. While the boyfriend was off at his brother's stag, I went back to the Chevy dealership to see what a Cavalier felt like, and to get a few more numbers from the salesman. Funny - I was told earlier in the week that there wasn't really bargaining room with a Cavalier because they made up 30% of the sales. This didn't make sense to me, and I realized why. When I was given a few more quotes on Saturday, suddenly the price was getting lower. Fancy that. Apparently prices are only flexible once they think you're actually serious. Oh, the battle! Chevy's got so many things going for them financially . . . I'd pay almost $100/mo less than if I got a similarly priced Toyota (the Matrix). And they have that Ring In to Win . . . and a better new grad rebate . . . ohhhhh, but the Matrix is what I want. Today's task is to talk to the bank and explore financing options instead of leasing. I really want that Matrix . . . can you tell? =) Anyways, after my mind had taken in all it could as far as cars went, I decided that a visit to my mum's was in order. I took my car (the awful one I'm replacing) to get a car wash on the way. No biggie - I figured it would be good to run it a short distance once a week, just to make sure it's still running fine. And all was fine. Until I took it home. And it started making the rattling noise again. I'm not usually a terribly emotional person, but I burst out crying. I really thought I'd had all the trouble I possibly could with that thing. And I still need a way to pay off the repairs. I hate to realize it, but I think friendships are going to have to be put aside so I (or more accurately, my boyfriend) can have it out with the shop. Hmmm . . . and then Sunday. Surprisingly, no more car stories for Sunday! =) It started out as a quiet day, with me determined to not get kicked out of the washer and dryer before I got all the laundry done. I ended up getting it all done without any competition. And I got to meet yet another cousin of my boyfriends. He has such a huge family! I'm constantly meeting new cousins, or aunts and uncles, or grandparents . . . and I still can't keep straight the names of his 4 younger brothers and step-brothers. And still no Christmas shopping . . . just barely a week left to do it! I'll get it done eventually. =) Today's car-du-jour . . . a Toyota Corolla. Although I still haven't had a chance to check out any import dealerships yet, I've had a lot of encouragement on this one. I was really surprised while doing my preliminary research online. The price of a Corolla is very similar to that of a Cavalier, and just a tad less than a Civic. Yet it's got more options that come standard than with the Civic for a similiar price, and has the reputation of holding its value much better than a Cavalier. Which means it's more likely to be worth more than the buy-out price, something that's difficult to say about the Cavalier. But enough about cars for now . Hmmm, I guess that runs me out of topics then. =) I just want the work day to be over so I can quit stewing and start looking. Much as I don't want to be rushed, I don't want to be borrowing my loaner car more than the 10 days it was given to me for. Which means I've got til the end of next week. And I certainly don't want my thoughts to be dominated by cars over Christmas! Ixtapa, Le! Sounds like your work benefits are starting to kick in . . . =) That's so exciting! Hope everyone has a good weekend . . . I've been reading a few more blogs lately , and I really like the format of bolding the first few words of each paragraph. It really makes it much easier on the eyes. Maybe I'll eventually come up with my own unique style. (yeah right) =) I'm very excited now about the whole idea of having a new car. I keep going back and forth - anyone who's been reading here, or who knows me in person, knows this is all I think or talk about. =) Gotta get some new material soon. I've never had a new vehicle, aside from the 3 days I was given a Toyota Echo while my car was being fixed (not my fault, I can assure you). My mum just bought her first new car in 17 years a few weeks back . . . before that, she drove an '85 Astro van that she's had since it was new in '85. Sadly, my preparation for Christmas has been overshadowed by this need for a more reliable vehicle. I don't have a tree up (though that's somewhat by choice - I shudder to think what my cats might do to it), no red-and-green decorations, and worst of all, no gift-shopping has been accomplished. Well, I had bought something for my mum, and after a week, decided it wasn't quite what I wanted to get her. By the time I can actually go to the mall, I'm going first thing in the morning armed with a list and a predetermined agenda. OK, really, where the heck is Leah? This is taunting me . . . I went to the dentist today for the first time in nearly 4 years. I'd forgotten how long that can take! I was a new patient to this dentist, so there were forms to fill out, introductions to make, questions to ask. The appointment was at 9am, and I didn't make it back to work until noon. But my teeth feel oh-so-clean, despite being a tad achey (I'm horrible for remembering to floss) . . . Well, time for a bank run, me thinks . Line ups are going to be crazy tomorrow, so I might as well get some of it done today. Besides, I like having an excuse to leave early. Since the banks are right across from my apartment, I've been told to "go on my way home." But since they're only open so late, I get to leave work early. =) Enh, I only like leaving early when there's really nothing better to do. Which is the case today. Salesmen make me nervous Does anyone else out there feel this way? It's instinct for me to be very leery and cautious around salesmen. Especially car salesmen. I mean, it's such a huge purchase, and most people (definitely include me in the category) and less-than-well-informed when it comes to buying a new car. It probably has a lot to do with stories I've heard, and the bias of people around me. I feel like if I don't know exactly what I want and exactly how much I should be paying, I'm going to be taken for a ride. Pardon the pun. =) I went car shopping for the very first time last night. So much to take in! My longest stop was the first, and still my best impression. Good impression #1 - The guy had a computer and offered me concrete numbers for various different options. Instead of trying to get me to buy up, he was doing everything he could to accomodate my needs. Perhaps the sales industry gets a bad rap. =) This was my local Chevy dealership. Good impression #2 - he managed to explain leasing to me in terms that I understood. I have a similar feeling regarding leasing as I do about car salesmen. =) However, my experience and knowledge on the subject is limited to what I've heard from family and friends, and various short online articles. There's definitely something to be said about being well-informed. I had an aunt who leased a vehicle, and she swore she'd never do it again. I never quizzed her on why. It was a Plymouth Breeze - maybe that has something to do with it. Or maybe she owed money at the end. I really don't know. But leasing makes so much sense for me. I can't put a large sum towards a down payment, and I need low monthly payments for the next while, and I'm extremely wary of getting another car that won't be good to me. This way, I get a brand new car, it's under warranty as long as I'm paying for it (as long as the lease, anyways), and my options are open at the end of the term. Some would argue (as I did, initially) that it makes no sense to pay for something I'm not going to own. Very good point. But cars are such money-pits anyways . . . how do I know I really WANT to own the car in 3-4 years? All I have to do is abide by the terms - not driving more than 20000km/year, keeping up the maintenance, and not abusing it - and I can hand it back for something else in a few years. I never ever thought I would be saying to people "Yeah, I'm leasing my car." But it looks like that's going to be the case . . . Good impression #3 - So far, GM offers the most attractive bonus for new grads ($1000), and their guaranteed $1000 off with ring in to win helps, too. If anyone knows of somewhere that offers better deals than this, by all means, let me know! =) Next up was a nearby Dodge/Chrysler one. I think I was biased to begin with (my current vehicle is a Dodge), but I wasn't given any definite numbers, nor did the salesman even have a computer at his disposal. Also, he didn't think I qualified for their new grad program cuz it was "just" a SAIT diploma program. He was a helpful and nice guy . . . but I wasn't wowed into buying a new Dodge SX to up my SX appeal. =) I like the slogan though. On tonight's agenda - an import dealership or two. Toyota, Hyundai, and Honda have excellent reputations when it comes to small cars . . . Friends are fleeting after all . . . To all those people who ever told me that friends would be the most reliable and constant thing in my life - that men merely come and go - I say BS. Friends are the ones that come and go, so you might as well put that extra effort into a relationship. Or maybe it's just female friends that come and go. At least in a relationship, once it reaches a certain point, both sides are willing to put in an effort to get to know the other person well. They give each other the benefit of the doubt. I don't know - maybe I just don't pick my friends very well. My apologies to any good friends who may be reading this. It's really only a handful of past friends that I'm angry about. Oh well . . . water under the bridge, right? Why should I waste time with ANYONE - man or woman - who can't be bothered to treat me like they would want to be treated? I shouldn't, and I won't. And I'm not going to waste anymore energy on this. As kelly would put it - I just needed to whine. =) PS If anyone out there can tell me how I can get my posts to show up in reverse order (still with the most recent day on top, but with the individual posts going from first to last, instead of last to first) . . . I'd appreciate that! A late list of Thanksgiving . . . Just so you people don't think I'm nothing but a whiney, self-pitying, spoiled brat . . . and to remind myself of what's actually GOOD right now . . . I'm thankful I have a supportive boyfriend. He lets me bitch and complain, and he's chauffeured me around, but he's also reminded me that it's not the end of the world. He won't let me wallow in self-pity. I'm thankful I know my mother still loves and supports me however she can. Even though I can't say the same for my father, at least I know she'll always be there. She's listened to me complain after I've worn my boyfriends ear off, and she empathizes in a way only mothers can do. I'm thankful I have a fulltime job that I enjoy. Even though things aren't always predictable, I know I'm pretty secure, and I actually want to do well for the company. When there's actually work to be done, of course. =) I'm thankful I've been able to get rides when I needed them. There have been many times I could have been told flat out "no", and although sometimes I've had to ask around, or make last-minute arrangements, I've always managed to get where I needed. I'm thankful I have a roof over my head. Despite how bad things may seem to me at times, I can still pay my rent, my bills (maybe late, some times), and for groceries. As long as I can keep doing that, I know I'm OK. I'm thankful I have the freedom to complain like I do. =) There are still countries where speaking your mind can get you killed. That's pretty awful. Well, I could keep going on like that . . . I guess there really are lots of things to be thankful for. I think I've accomplished what I'd set out to do. I hope everyone has a good day. =) Honesty doesn't pay OK, now on to the next topic. I learned a valuable lesson yesterday - it doesn't pay to be honest. I recently applied for a second job. The personnel company was very impressed with my testing scores, and the hours and pay were perfect for me. I was told as soon as I was interviewed that I had the job. Wonderful. The money was really going to help out greatly. It was to start yesterday evening. I was devastated when I realized that my boyfriend's brother's wedding fell on one of the weekends I would be working. But I told the agency rep at the orientation about it, and she seemed pretty sure it wouldn't be a problem - she just needed to know when it was exactly, in case I needed the whole shift off, or just a few hours. It turns out I could still work a couple of hours that day. Yesterday, she called me up and again assured me she didn't think it would be a problem. Less than an hour before I was to leave for this job, she called me back. Apparently it's a problem with the client - they need people who can commit to the full 4 weeks. Yet during the orientation, it was stressed that family emergencies were valid reasons for missing a shift, just don't have 35 of them. So I was replaced at the last minute without even having a say in it. I wasn't even given the choice to say I wouldn't go to the wedding (not that I would - but they don't know how important or unimportant this wedding was to me) . . . I was simply replaced. I was crushed. I'm sure some (many, probably) people are thinking, "Oh, cry me a river . . . lots of people have worse problems." I'm sure they do, and I know things could be worse . . . but it doesn't make what's going on any less stressful knowing that. I just try to remind myself that I believe that everything happens for a reason. Everything happens for a reason. Not that I think I can afford to, but I suppose now I'll have the time to go car shopping. And since my loaner car, which I thought would gladly be lent to me for a month or so, is only reluctantly mine for a week or 10 days, I suppose that's a good thing. And I'm tired of relying on other people for things - generosity of rides, mainly. Although some people offered "let me know if you need a ride", some never came through, and those who did, I can tell their patience is wearing thin. I don't blame them. So, lesson learned yesterday . . . as far as parttime work goes, I don't have a life. I just have lots of sick relatives. Noisy ld not be my first priority if I had my husband for a mere 24 hours. I'd've made the polite introductions around the camp, given him the 2-second tour so he could go home and say he'd been there, and then I'd be dragging him off into the bushes. Nobody would sees, ride! I love rollercoasters, but I'm hating today. I'm livid. Absolutely, positively livid. I'm almost sick to my stomach. And since there doesn't seem to be much I can do now, I will use this as a venting forum. I hadn't heard a peep from the car shop since last Wednesday. I was getting a little nervous - but all I was thinking was that my car had been pushed to the bottom of the pile of priorities. Which wouldn't have been a big deal. I have a new car now - my only deadline is selling it before I owe money for the repairs. But no. I get a phone call this afternoon saying my car is ready to go. Excuse me???? - I was still waiting to hear how much it was going to cost after a part had been sent to the machining shop. After a couple of seconds, I recovered enough to ask how much the bill was. I didn't want to know. The naive part of myself (growing ever smaller every day) hoped that he'd seen the light and was only charging me what I'd told him I could afford - $300. The larger part - the paranoid part - dreaded what he was going to tell me. I was dumbfounded - $707. No bloody f*&$%ing way. Can I say that on here? Well, I just did. So what is there for me to do? Nothing, really, except call him back and argue with him. It's his word against mine. Me: "Do you recall the conversation we had last week when I told you $300 was all I was spending?" Him: "Well, yes, and I told you that the estimate was $584 and to think about it." Me: "Yes, and I said you could go ahead and send it to the machining shop with the understanding that I would get a more accurate estimate before going ahead with anymore work." Him: "I gave you the estimate before it was sent." Me: "Yes, and you also said that you didn't know for sure that it could even be fixed. That it could cost more or less or they could even say 'we won't touch it.' I made it very how much I was willing to spend." Him: "I was only going to call you back if they said they couldn't fix it." And it only got worse from there. This is just a nightmare. He says he's already giving me a discount, so of course he thinks he's being the good guy. Yay - he's giving me a discount of half the hours from the last job (less than if he was discounting half the hours from the current job) applied to the current work. Sure, maybe it seems like he's compromising, but my car was only back in the shop because that last job didn't do anything to fix my car. It's all his word against my word. What the hell can I do? I called the BBB, and they

said because the shop is holding my car, there isn't much they can do. Read: pay them what they want, and then fight to get it back. Well, when I don't have the money in the first place, how the hell do you propose I do that? The suggestion was made (I won't mention by whom) to find the spare key and simply drive off with the car. As angry as I am, I do not want a criminal charge added to my woes. My plan at the moment (and it changes every few minutes) is to drive down there, ask for my car, and tell them to charge the repairs to my Petro-Can card. And drive off fast. Because it'll get declined. I said $300 was all I was paying for a very good reason - it was how much room I had left on my Petro-Canada card. Which would put me $3000 total in the hole for a car that I could only hopefully sell for that much. Hopefully being the operative word. I don't even know for sure yet that it's going to run once I take it home. Knowing my luck, and the track record with the shop, I'll probably get it home and it'll be clunking again. But after just long enough for them to be able to say "Well, it was working when we test-drove it." Maybe I should call in to the police and say it's stolen .
