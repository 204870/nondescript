years, I have been asking God for more people. Not just in the congregation but for more fulltimers. And hey so far, the camps weve been having are raising up more and more full timers. Hehe. =) I guess you could say that even without your knowledge, i was indirectly praying for you, isis, gigi and the others who stood up sa recent camps naton. Well, daw laba naman ni gani ang akon nga na sulat. Just text me or give a kol when your here na a. I'll be waiting. Dont forget PASALUBONG!!!!! Hehehehehehehe. Bacolod's famous chicken. =) Take Care. GOD BLESS. =) Grabe Donj! Believe na gd ko ah! hehe We want more! hehe Pati ah :) Keren: as u wish... Full name: Donjun Jocson Somodio Address: Somewhere in Quezon City Provincial Address: U.S.A. (Unhan Sang Airport) Date of birth: July 26, 1988 Place of birth: Bacolod City Civil Status: Single Religion: Baptist Height: 5 ft.6in. Occupation: System Administrator (Janitorial System) Office: Admired Technologies, Inc. WANT MORE?.... will be available upon request. Koolitz aka Donj: Please introduce yourself. Poi pa gid! hehe :) Now I have combat attack for SARS! hehe Edmar: Gani man, you're gonna learn how to sing when you're doing it for God. :) You should hear Gemma's singing career story... hehe ... kun pano sha ka-reach sang high-flying falsettos nya ala Charlotte Church! haha (Pati Gem, galing kay tuod man gid, CC always come to mind when I hear you! :)) Oh, you had piano lessons gle? Cool! :) Ako man gani before, pero feeling ko di man ko gifted sa music! hehe Congratulations again sa imo and sa shoti mo yesterday sa baptismal nyo! I'm very happy for the both of you gid. :) I forgot to ask you, when's the exact date of your treatment gale? Naka-schedule na? :) And Neil's right, that could really give you time for reflection. God bless gid. :) Neil: Techie? Define "techie" please. hehe I'm not either, long way to go pa ko da ya! hehe Mauna na ko da ya lakat sa 3, sila pa sa 5th! hehe Kun tani may pa-istar ka sila Neil dugay na kami ara da! hehe Oh yeah, grabe gle busy sa school ka noh? Pero I know you can do it Neil! Kaw pa, I've always believed in you. (Wow! Compliment #1, lista sa notepad! haha *joke*) Cge lang pag kayod sa Phil. Lit., that's one of my fave subjects here galing kay inyo ya in Filipino gid. hehe Ahh, we can't promise you anything Neil. Pero I know God is working gid sa youth ta subong! I can see changes, miski jutay lang. :) Hmm.. not necessarily sa blog, but writing in general. Ok, how was I sure nga ma full-time ko? I asked God for a confirmation. Many weeks before sa THE EDGE nga camp, I was really praying hard about it that I coud hear God speak to me. Perhaps you could recall, if you were watching closely sa amon ni Isis and Gigi, and not to forget, Gemma, sa likod pag consecration night... Pagtawag sang Lifetime Dedication, I didn't have any drive to move forward. Isis started to cry when I told her, "Full-time na gid ni ya... " I actually joined her pero I came back to my senses and realized I shouldn't be swept away with my emotions (I actually laughed nga amo to gin ubra ko kay nadala ko sa iya hibi`... haha) so I stood straight in front of Ptr. Dave sa likod nayon, when he was calling na for Full-time dedication. I could remember that I asked to hear "GO" ... because a few weeks prior to that sa discipleship namon nga prayer, ang verse nga " Go and make discipleships of all nations ... " (Matt 28:19) came to mind. So during that time sa dedication, I was struggling to go forward and backward again, as though ... ambot, indescribable! hehe Basta, I knew at that moment I was called gid, I heard "Go, go, go, go ... " in my head. And when I went to the front, I felt peace, peace that passes all understanding, it's like, you just know when you know. hehe Remember ko gd ara ka to sa una naga-smile-smile while playing the guitar! haha And yes, I had doubts before that, that's why I asked for confirmation. And also days after that, those questions bala, "Basi ako lang to ya ..." Galing kay we know how the devil likes to feed us with lies. And when we know the truth, it sets us free! :) Now, I'm excited about sa BSOP na conference because I know I will be learning a lot gid didto and once again clarify kun Full-time or Part-time: Which Are Thou? hehe Pray for me pls. Hmm.. how about you Neil? :) Also don't worry about it, na realize ko nga amo ka gd na ya gale, most endearing trait (hehe) and I learned to accept it. :) Apology accepted, and I'm also sorry for ignoring you sometimes cos d ko pa na chindihan before eh. Although sometimes you can be REALLY IRRITATING! haha I'm looking forward to have lagaws with you guys too! hehe Gusto actually nila Rosan & Co. kadto sa Enchanted, ambot lang kun may time pa na ... basta lagaw mo gd kami Neil ha! :) Problema lang nila is pano transpo pakadto sa Pasay (building ni Achi B) from UECP, then mag go home na, Pasay to Pier -- dilemma! Sigh. That is kun ma stay sila kay Achi B, pero may gin offer man to kanday Khuey Amah Hong Giap So na bata, sa may Greenhills daw, pero d pa sure cos 4 lang maka-sleep sa bed and others will be in the sala na daw. hehe 7 sila tanan mag-stay for lagaw, +1 = 8 (that's me! hehe) Wow, grabe, SUPER LABA na gid ni ya. Sorry fellow Ramdom Ramblers, I'm sort of making this my own blog na! hehe God bless your week y'all! :D o yeah, and I forgot, Laurz, try be email sa akon. I'll see if i receive it. If i do, i'll try to reply to it. Thanks. Grabe ba, namis gid ko sang tanan nga mga tawo. I'm so very touched. Hehe. =) Kailinit a, wala pa ko gyapon net. I had to borrow from a dormate nga na connect na ya sang isp namon diri sa dorm. O well, i'm not that much of a "techy" pa naman a. Diba ren? Hehe. Dasiga na di bala lakat para kagwa ta di. Daw feeling ko indi nagid ninyo ko love. Naks. Hehe. =) O well, i'm dying here because of schoolwork. I can't believe how fast summer goes. @ chapters on sociology in a matter of days and a really long test this friday na. Not to mention studying -pa for my "Literature of the Phils." subject. Man, all the more i'm hating filipino. =) To the bacolod people, musta na da kamo. Hows BTCC doing. You'd better promise me sa pagbalik ko mas nag-improve nagid ta. Or else mahibi gid ko. Kumusta na da ang mga leaders. Ren, since hambal mo sakon mas free ka magtok over blog then answer me some of these ?'s. How were you able to be sure nga mafull-time ka? Was there ever a time nga nagdoubt ka about going full time? (Btw, in case your wondering, no i'm not doubting but please answer the ?'s lang, thanks gid.) Kumusta na da gli knday gemz, gigi, isis, laurz, ,elissa, michy and the other women? How bout the guys? Pray gid da kamo for andrew ha. I can tell you nga budlay gid life diri ya. He needs all the covering he can get. I need as much covering as i can get. Guys, congatulate edmar and his little bro raymund. They got baptized kagina sa prince david (Condo where ptr. johnny and atsi len lives in). Ed, happy gid ko nga kamo ni shote mo nagdecide nga mapabaptize. And I am really looking forward to work together with you in the immediate future. :p And i'm also looking forward to the many lagaws that we will be having together. Btw, God bless gali para sa treatment mo this coming week. Hope everything turns out fine. Maybe you can spend the time meditating on some issues, huh? =) Well, i guess i'll have to end here for now. Dunno when I can be online again. I hope the dorm isp can get be connected asap (NO!!!!! I AM NOT A TECHY!!! Hehe) And ker, kung abi mo ang mga suya ko is just my way of harassing you, well ma-apologize na lang gid ko daan kay amo lang gid ko na ya. Sunluganon loang gid ko nga tawo. Ask everybody. God bless all of you guys. To the FCCF delagates, hope that I'll be able to meet with you guys while you are here. ei! another rambler, hi koolitz.... hmmm.... we should keep an updated data on who's who's haha... i dont know na... daw hinay hinay na gadamo rambler! ;O) keren, didnt know choir is that HARD! i have hard time catching up wd them, my only musical backround was a few(very few) piano lesson! when i was tsill in elem, and all i could rember is do ri mi fa so la ti do! aside from that wala na, i dont really have the talent to sing... and i cant distinguished the tones and i was put sa bass, when jerson(choir member) sing very low, i sing a higher tune! wah! hay... when they were introducing us after the practice, the pianist told " ah! your edmar! your the one singing higher than the rest(bass)" wah!!!! i cant sing! but had fun tho hehhe... the conductor told me something that help me to do my best.."when your singing for God, ...you're going to learn to sing...." ;o) have a blessed sunday everyone!;o) WELCOME GUYZ! Thanks for JOINING here! heheh daw piho man?!! Newayz...share ko lang ni hu ah.. ---- Hi there, this is a FYI only. This is a forward message: Dear Brothers and Sisters in Christ, My sister in Hong Kong told me there's a recipe for the prevention and treatment of SARS, given by some alleged Divine Source in 1986 and published in a book at that time. I am not going to comment on that source here, but I do want to share this recipe with you: Garlic 1 clove Ginger a few slices Lemon juice 1 table spoon Honey 1 tea spoon Mince and press the garlic and ginger in a cup, add the lemon juice and honey, then add boiling hot water to it, mix and brew for a while. Drink and eat the entire content. Since the ingredients garlic, ginger, lemon, honey and water are all good for health, I feel confident enough to pass this information to you. The story went that a certain doctor in Hong Kong contracted a severe flu in Jan. this year. At that time nobody even knew about SARS, but she was so severely ill that she thought she was going to die in spite of all the antiviral agents and antibiotics she was taking. Then she remembered the book that she read about the alleged prophecy and alleged remedy, she tried this brew. Miraculously, she recovered almost immediately. However, she has passed the disease to her daughter, so she gave the same remedy to her daughter and she too recovered quickly. Meanwhile, her nurse contracted the sickness too, so she gave that to the nurse and she immediately recovered without the use of any other medication. I leave it to the reader to discern what this means, to believe or not to believe. You are free to pass on this information, in fact, a friend even suggested that I should e-mail this to WHO, but I don't know their e-mail address, you, however, can do that if you like. Or, if you don't believe it, simply delete it. As for me, I place myself completely in God's hands. If it is God's will for me to contract SARS and die, I seek not to escape from it. But then, perhaps it is God's will that I should take something whose smell and taste I have dreaded all my life as an act of penance, afterall, we are still in the lenten period...just two more weeks to go. Then again, maybe it is God's will that I should eat the dreaded garlic and still die of SARS, so be it. Until you hear from the news that all the people in Hong Kong are suddenly cured of SARS and the supermarkets all ran out of garlic and ginger, it is difficult to be certain. Meanwhile, be happy, stay healthy and smell garlicky. Kathy Wu IT Support Homes for the Aged Div. (416) 392-2944 kwu@toronto.ca Hello Donj! :D knock! knock!

They held this truth so dear that they were willing to suffer torture and death rather than renounce it. This startling message so electrified their ministry that their testimony "turned the world upside down" (Acts 17:6). It is still true today: The Holy Spirit honors the witness of those who proclaim the resurrected Jesus. They do not point primarily to moral codes, religious rituals, or theological creeds (good as these may be in themselves), but to the living God-man who alone can save. It is to Him who is "alive forevermore" (Revelation 1:18) that we should look in these days of dead orthodoxy and spiritual apostasy. A proud and ungodly professor said to a young child who believed in the Lord Jesus, "My dear little girl, you don't know whom you believe in. There have been many christs. In which of them do you believe?" "I know which one I believe in," replied the child. "I believe in the Christ who rose from the dead!" Jesus is alive (Luke 24:1-12). Your eternal life depends on it. - Henry Bosch Although our Lord was crucified, He rose up from the grave; He paid our penalty for sin, Then showed His power to save. - Sper why people dont pray: a. ignorance: dont know how to pray b. overconfidence: that we could do everything on our own c. unbelief: we dont believe that God answers prayer d. lazy: prayer is labor e. feeling of independence The power of prayer that's the theme for this year QCEC summer conference and indeed God was in our mindst... for 3 days we had a great time learning new things and meeting new people, meeting new friends. :O) this is my first time to attend such a conference and i was really fun.:O) hay... bitin nga lang... sana mahaba haba... hehe:O) Well, everybody's going somewhere this Holy Week! :) ENJOY gid kamo tanan! :D Kami stay lang d, cos may role ko sa Easter Presentation sa Sunday. So if mag lakat sila, wala na, ako karon lang isa bilin di sa house ... hehe Well, mabal-an lang na cos first day pa man lang of doing nothing. hehe Kun ma-boringan sila they'd probably think of going somewhere. LOL I'm ok na Edmar :) Thanks gid. :D Same day it went out, same day it also went away. Thank God! :D Hmm.. contact dermatitis sa toothpaste? Grabe.

Kasubo` :( I'm here! I'm here! :) hellooo! hmmm... where are you all? :) I DREAMT I STOOD AT CALVARY I dreamt I stood at Calvary And saw three crosses there; On left and right were nailed two thieves, The cross between was bare. A soldier took his sword in hand, Then pointed it at me: He said "You there, prepare to die. That cross is meant for thee." I quickly fell upon my knees, For mercy did I cry; As strong hands grabbed my hands and feet, I shouted "Why, oh why?" And then a voice both soft and sweet Was heard above the din; "Let this one go, take me instead. I'll pay his price for sin." With his body torn and bleeding And thornmarks round his head; With bruises where they beat him, He stepped into my stead. Then Jesus laid upon the cross, His life did freely give, That all my sins be washed away And through his death, I'd live. He stretched his arms out open wide, No struggle did he make. As they prepared to nail him there His life they meant to take. They drove the spikes in hands and feet, And slammed the cross in place. His bones were shaken out of joint, And blood ran down his face. "Forgive them, Father," was his cry, They know not what they do God must have wept when he realized He sacrificed his only Son for you. When I awoke, the night had passed And Sunshine flooded in; I cried "Dear Lord, forgive me please, And cleanse me of my sin. For you sent down your only son, A ransom for the lost: And I see you included me, When counting out the cost. Yes I dreamt I stood at Calvary And saw those crosses three; Yet no longer do I need to fear Knowing Jesus died for me. Awww .... cge lang Edmar. Graduate ka naman ah, review na man lang na eh. God bless sa studies mo! :) Hey, I'm starting to work on the CCOWE website now. hehe :) hmmm.... last summer? i didnt have a summer last year, intership started april 1 kaya i dint really have a summer:O( unlike you guys... hay this summer naman buas na start review class... hay... i dont miss school, ill be going back to it tom... hay... cge na lng... hehe:O) Mel: My pleasure. :) Hmm...

Gani man Edmar. :) Well, when we have the chance to chat again, catch up on some things lang. hehe Pasensha lang gd kamo ... down naman ang site .... nag crash abi ang server .... hehehe :) Oh well! :D The Hammer, the File and the Furnace It was the enraptured Rutherford who said in the midst of very painful trials and heartaches: Praise God for the hammer, the file, and the furnace. Letís think about that. The hammer is a useful and handy instrument. It is essential and helpful tool, if nails are ever to be driven into place. Each blow forces them to bite deeper as the hammerís head pounds and pounds. But if the nails had feelings and intelligence, it would give us another side of the story. To the nail, the hammer is a brutal, relentless master---an enemy who loves to beat it into submission. That is the nailís view of the hammer. It is correct. Except for one thing. The nail tends to forget that both it and the hammer are held by the same workman. The workman decides whose ìheadî will be pounded out of sightÖand which hammer will be used to do the job. This decision is the sovereign right of the carpenter. Let the nail but remember that it and the hammer are held by the same workmanÖand its resentment will fade as it yields to the carpenter without complaint. The same analogy holds true for the metal that endures the rasp of the file and the blast of the furnace. If the metal forgets that it and the tools are the objects of the same craftsmanís care, it will build up hatred and resentment. The metal must keep in mind that the craftsman knows what heís doingÖand is doing what is best. Heartaches and disappointments are like the hammer, the file and the furnace. They come in all shapes and sizes: an unfulfilled romance, a lingering illness and untimely death, an unachieved goal in life, a broken home or marriage, a severed friendship, a wayward and rebellious child, a personal medical report that advises ìimmediate surgery,î a failing grade at school, a depression that simply wonít go away, a habit you canít seem to break. Sometimes heartaches come suddenlyÖother times they appear over the passing of many months, slowly as the erosion of the earth. Do I write to a ìnailî that has began to resent the blows of the hammer? Are you at the brink of despair, thinking that you cannot bear another day of heartache? Is that whatís gotten you down? As difficult as it may be for you to believe this today, the Master knows what Heís doing. Your Savior knows your breaking point. The bruising and crushing and melting process is designed to reshape you, not ruin you. Your value is increasing the longer He lingers over you. A. W. Tozer agrees: It is doubtful whether God can bless a man greatly until He has hurt him deeply. Aching friend---stand fast. Like David when calamity caved in, strengthen yourself in the Lord your God (1 Sam. 30:6). Godís hand is in your heartache. Yes, it is! If you werenít important, do you think He would take this long and work this hard on your life? Those whom God uses most effectively have been hammered, filed and tempered in the furnace of trials and heartaches. Take time to thank your Master for any trials and heartaches in this season of your life. And meditate afresh on James 1:2-22. Excerpt from Come Before Winter & Share My Hope by Charles Swindoll, pp.158-159 Hi edmar....thanx for the poem...very suitable gid for me...:) musta na? u very ok na and all? for everybody...peeps, jz wanna share what i read....it really struck in the depths of my heart.. kerena, kerena...hehehe...see u later.... miss u so...hehehe...dapat indi ko mag-amu na...akigan naman ta na ni pooh bear neil cortez...hehehe...btw, m startin with skool naman tom...hay, when will october come...anyweiz pray for me, that i will get good professors that will help us learn more about computer stuff and all...:) Btw, about meteor garden, medyo lost gid ko da coz when it's on air, m still in church working or on my way hom....pls..what's the craze over it??? cant relate...felt being lost....hehehe...

Sorry Gems. Kamusta ka na? Ok ka na? Edmar, kaw man? Musta na? Mel & Neil, balik na blog. Donj! How is work? Bon, wru? Poi, busy gd permi? To the rest, I hope everything is going well with you. I WAS NOT CALLED "I cannot go," I hear you say, "It's not my work; I was not called. Too bad so many die that way, Without a hope, without a God, But here at home I have to stay." But then I hear my Savior say, "It was my work to die for you. In Heav'n I did not please to stay. I came to earth not for a few, But all should know I am the Way." "I cannot go," I hear you say, "My child is small And he needs all the world can give him today. It would not do to be so cruel To one who cannot choose his way." And then I hear my Father say, "I gave My Son, My only One, to give the world the only Way. He suffered alll upon the cross. Can you do less for Me today?" "I cannot go," I hear you say, "It takes so much Of strength and grace. I have no talents to display, My faith is weak; right here I'll stay. The smart and strong go far away." I hear my Lord and Master say, "Have you not read Within My Word, 'Ye are vessels made of clay?' I choose the weak to give My strength. Let all who will serve Me today." A Poem by Russell Kelfer You are who you are for a reason. you're part of an intricate plan. you're a precious and perfect unique design, called God's special woman or man. You look like you look for a reason. our God made no mistake. He knit you together within the womb, you're just what he wanted to make. The parents you had were the ones he chose, and no matter how you may feel, They custom-designed with God's plan in mind, and they bear the master's seal No, the trauma you faced was not easy. and God wept that it hurt you so; But it was allowed to shape your heart So that into his likeness you'd grow. you are who you are for a reason, you've been formed by the master's rod you are who you are, beloved, because there is a GOD! helllo.... kerena, where art thou?

Tsk. I know Donj! haha Oh man, wala na gd d ya naga-blog. How sad. :( anybody home? hehehe hullo! ari man ko d ah! hehehe :-) You guys can check out urlLink www.namfrel.org for the latest National Quick Count.. as of now, GMA leads FPJ by almost 1.2 Million votes.. And Noli De Castro leading by 1.1 Million votes over to Loren Legarda.. We've been talking about the Presidential Candidates here that we forgot about the Vice-President.. Whom did you vote for Vice-President? I voted urlLink Herminio Aquino .. To know a little more about the candidates (although it's too late! hehe), urlLink CLICK HERE .. Check out urlLink FPJ , coz' his profile was all about showbiz and none about politics.. Whoever wins, let's just pray about it! :) Success and Development doesn't only depend on our leaders but also on the people under them.. Let's just pray for Cooperation and Unity across the nation.. :) Well, it looks like most of us voted, to say the least, rooted for, Bro. Eddie. After the elections, when the battle's between the three heads: GMA, FPJ and if Ping would have caught up with them. I'd go for Ping na lang! (I have my own convictions) Local elections: Bing was declared a winner locally, but not yet nationally. Some people are speculating and I hear rumors about pressing charges? What? Template stuff: I changed it, again! haha No, it's not random. Just love to experiment that's all. Question again, what is your favorite Blogger template as of this moment? And oh my, I've seen Eddie Gil over Wazzup-Wazzup (sp?) and in local shows. As one survey goes, Do you think Eddie Gil should go for showbiz instead? Therefore, my conclusion is, PRAY FOR THE PHILIPPINES. (Huh? Connection?) Welcome to the new RR-ers, by the way! :) Rock on! hehe gina pa ko ga comment comment di ko tani magpost pero daw ka damo na comment ko eh wahehhe well in response to keren.. I go for bro. eddie pero wala ko ka vote kay wala ko d ka pa reg sa manila hehe c MM nalang nag vote for me.. like i said ang strategy nila nga "Vote GMA or FPJ will win" effective gd katama.. publish a survey that FPJ is leading..dollar rate is rising..blah blah..well cno man nga tawo indi kulbaan? so ang tawo ma vote nalang sang tawo nga ga second kay FPJ sa survey.. they voted for GMA not because she is the right leader but of fear that FPJ will win.. no offense ha.. basta that's reality.. ;) but i guess all we have to do now is to pray to GOD for our country. enough said... Keren: meeeee too! I'm a sucker for foreign accents.. my favorite is british!! hehe. it's remarkably head-spinning! it's like a drug.. but i don't do drugs!! haha.. and i'm speakin' while i'm writing this! haha.. u can just go right ahead and imagine me doing it.. :) i'm insane! i know.. i've said that several times already in my whole life.. (still speaking in a british accent.. haha!) who did i vote? well, it's supposed to be a secret but it doesn't matter now.. this would be a shock to some of you guys, but i didn't vote Eddie Villanueva.. If Eddie Gil was still on the list, I would vote him!! NOT!!! haha.. We have a reason why we didn't vote him and I don't want to stress it out.. :) we all can vote whoever we want and that's totally okay.. it's a freedom! (",) But if you insist on asking my reasons of not voting Mr Villanueva, well then I think I would tell you about it, i think? hehe.. anyway, i voted GMA! why so? let's say i voted for Ping Lacson.. would that do me any good? I don't think so, coz' as you can see, he's soooooooooo far away from winning.. and if i voted him, gma would lose 1 vote and that's a plus 1 for FPJ.. and the outcome? it could be a disaster! hehe.. what if my vote was the last one that could keep FPJ from winning? now that's not a pretty sight! you get my point right? I would help out GMA just to keep FPJ from winning.. but that's not all the reason why I voted her, of course! hehe.. we can't hide the fact that she's intelligent, right? she went to hardvard with clinton for crying out loud! hehe.. some may say that she's corrupt, but who isn't? if some may say that they aren't and will not compromise, hmmmm.. i think that's totally impossible! coz' some already did some compromising, as seen on tv.. don't ask me about it okay? hehe.. if you know what i'm talkin' about, then keep it to yourself so that we can avoid arguements.. :) hehe.. about choosing a candidate that i think would win, well that wasn't on my mind at all.. my head was all focused on qualification and experience.. enough about credentials and stuff about qualification or calling or whatever! the voting had already been done for.. let's just support whoever sits on which seat.. :) we won't achieve any economic development if we don't unite and cooperate.. (",) let's just pray for a peaceful election culmination.. viva EDDIE GIL!!!! haha.. (",) I'm a retard!!! Aloha! Wahoo OK na PC ko! ^_^ I voted for Bro. Eddie. You guys should have voted for someone na you think deserves to be voted, not for someone who you're thinking would win, on which your vote would have mattered. As my dad said, wasted vote na sya if you voted for someone who's expected to win. Pero if you voted for someone na gusto mo gid, despite the fact na he or she's not winning, indi na wasted vote because you know na that person deserved your vote gid. Goshness, seriousness! Haha! Argh, politics shmolitics! Kagamo gid sang Philippines. Let's leave it na lang kay Lord. But asked whom I'm rooting for by this time, it's GMA. Anyway, ano man, naka random ni sya ang templates? Coz the last time I visited, it was green, now it's blue/bluegreen. Hehe. Pres GMA is leading about a million now as of this hour, with about 22% of the precints are counted. I hope she wins, even of the corruption and all that rather than having an actor president for 6 years..can you imagine that? haha! labay2 lg ko hi..thnxs for invite.. Did Bing won? Hindi na guid ako updated sa politics sa Pilipinas. I would've voted for Roco, pero I heard he did something daw to ruin his reputation. Ay ahay, it seems like that Edsa dos was long forgotten na. Waay na gid ya gakadudla ang iban nga mga botante sa nagkalatabo sng una? Arghh... It's too depressing that I force myself to believe that I don't care anymore what happens sa politics dira. But the truth is, I still can't stop hoping for some miracle to happen. Ker, mga maayo nga kandidato, aton nga kandidato, usually don't win.... sad noh? nakapost na ko before ko na basahan ang latest blog ni K...‹ as for me, i voted for GMA. Mas ok tani kng si Brother Eddie, pero i considered the probabilities man bala kng sin-o gd ang laban≤ na madaog...‹ if I voted for Brother Eddie, and GMA and FPJ both have the same number of votes (it would be impossible to happen pero what if lang yah bala aw...), kanugon sng vote ko eh... tani nagdaog pa si GMA... after the election, i haven't slept gd gani. Pati ako nagpulaw sa net while waiting for the results sa urlLink abs-cbn . I'm very worried gid about the election result. I really don't want FPJ to win. What will happen to my future if he becomes the president of the Philippines? Tsk tsk tsk... God have mercy on me! I'm graduating next year and I don't want to be on the list of unemployed fresh graduates... hello everyone!‹ hmmmm... la lang... labay lang ko ah...‹ thanks gd gali for the invite!‹ Bon, I'm a sucker for most accents especially Singaporean (I'm weird) and British.

Dog Fancy was a monthly magazine dedicated to dogs, owners of dogs, and breeders of dogs. It was founded in 1970 and was described by its publishing company, BowTie Inc., as "the world’s most widely read dog magazine".[1] BowTie Inc. also published its sister magazine Dog World and Cat Fancy for cats and their owners. The editorial office was in Irvine, Calif., and the statement of ownership in the December 2009 issue says the paid circulation was 202,000 copies. In August 2008, it began publishing a quarterly double issue entitled Natural Dog on the flip side of Dog Fancy. In late 2014, I-5 Publishing announced that the monthly magazines Cat Fancy and Dog Fancy would be cancelled, and replaced with alternating bimonthly issues of Catster and Dogster beginning in February 2015.
