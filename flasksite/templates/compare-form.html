100 Things About Me . . . Inspired by the blogs I've been reading lately: 1. I have my very first brand new car (a 2003 blue Honda Civic coupe). . . duh! =) 2. I wish I had more doodads at home . . . a digital camera would be cool! 3. I have 2 black cats, Tigger and Jazz. Tigger is a snob, Jazz is a pig. But I love them both. 4. I have 3 younger brothers, and we're all almost exactly 2 years apart. Who says the rhythm method doesn't work? =) 5. I enjoy my job as a petroleum technologist. 6. I wish I could have the best of both worlds, and get paid for learning instead of the other way around. 7. I once had a hamster named Webster. He died of asthma, or at least died wheezing. 8. I once had a hamster named Fluffy. She died of a tumor. Hamsters aren't very good pets. =( 9. I lived on West Timor Island, Indonesia for 8 months when I was 15 (with my family, of course). 10. I was in French immersion until grade 7. 11. I was incredibly shy as a child, and still am with strangers. 12. I never had an imaginary friend. 13. I wanted to be a vet when I was younger. 14. I also wanted to be an astronaut . . . 15. I wanted to be a geneticist when I was in high school. OK, that's a 100-list in itself . . . =) 16. I hate wearing glasses, and wear contacts unless I absolutely physically cannot (like this week). 17. My parents are divorced, and one is remarried. 18. I never want to get divorced. 19. I was engaged shortly before 20, unengaged shortly after 21. 20. I love sleeping in. 21. Summer is my favorite season, and I hate having to work through it. 22. I hated being unemployed this past summer (go figure *L*). 23. I hate waiting. 24. I have all 10 fingers and toes. 25. If my mum gets remarried to someone with a last name that starts with a C, her initials will be ABC. 26. I love to swim. 27. If I have children, they'll learn to swim before they walk. 28. I set several provincial swimming records when I was younger. 29. Most have been broken by now. What the hell do they feed kids these days?! 30. I have strawberry blonde hair, and always wish it was redder. 31. My grandpa always compliments my hair. I love my grandpa. =) 32. I love sincere compliments that come out of the blue. 33. I once had a cruch on Jonathan Brandis when I was in junior high. 34. I am convinced that I had an online fling with Ethan Embry, though some part of me will always wonder if it really was him, or some sap with too much time on his hands. 35. I used to be a net addict. 36. I'm not a cyber-virgin, but it's not something I'd do again. It's actually kind of sad. 37. I prefer the real thing. =) 38. I would eventually like to be a member of the Mile High club. Just to say I did it. 39. I like my coffee from Tim Hortons, with 2 cream and one sugar. 40. I usually add another sugar cube when I get to work. 41. I once ran away from home. I honestly thought it would be one less thing for my parents to worry about if I wasn't around. I think I was 13 or 14. 42. My father doesn't talk to me anymore (unrelated to 41, as far as I know). 43. I have moved 6 times since I was 18, and am about to move twice more in the next couple of months. 44. I don't like moving. 45. I find routines reassuring and stifling all at once. =) 46. I don't fix into a box (figuratively . . . I could, literally, if it was big enough). 47. I like to know the big picture before I'm told details or individual steps. 48. I think Sean Connery was and will always be the best James Bond. 49. I think Vin Diesel is pretty awesome eye candy. 50. My hair almost reached my butt when I was 8 years old. 51. I sometimes miss how my mum used to brush my hair and play with it when I was young. 52. Sometimes I'm glad I never had a sister. 53. Sometimes I'm sad that I never had a sister. 54. I know that "baca" means both "read" and "boyfriend" in Indonesian. 55. I love filtered/bottled water. Tap water tastes funny. 56. I still eat KD. 57. I still eat PB&J sandwiches from time to time (today, actually!) 58. I am not terribly good at keeping friends. There are many from my childhood that I wish I had kept in touch with. 59. My very first boyfriend's name was Peter. We grossed everyone out by holding hands on the school bus. I was in grade 3. 60. I never kissed a boy until the summer after I graduated high school. 61. I was no longer a virgin less than a year later. 62. I can count on one hand the number of men I've "been with". Just so you don't get the wrong impression. =) 63. I try not to judge people by their covers. 64. I would be lost without post-it notes . . . the saying "You'd forget your head at home in the morning if it wasn't attached" is quite accurate with me. 65. My parents always said "buggy" instead of shopping cart. So do I. People think I'm weird. I think it's different. And different is good. 66. I don't call it a boot (trunk), lift (elevator), or trousers (pants) . . . but I love Bristol-speak. 67. I have cool cousins over in England, but I've only met 2 of them (and an aunt and uncle). 68. I want to travel more. 69. Apart from never having money, I loved being a student. 70. I like having money - enough to be comfortable. But really, is there ever "enough" for the average person? 71. I am sometimes guilty of seeing material possessions as a sign of success and status. 72. I love my boyfriend. 73. I love my family. 74. I don't see my family often enough, especially my Papa. 75. I have never heard my Papa say a single bad thing about my Nana. He comes just shy of worshipping her and her memory . . . I wish more couples were like that these days. 76. I was baptized Roman Catholic as a baby. 77. I don't go to church . . . sadly, not even on special occasions. 78. I do not look highly on "holiday worshippers" who call themselves religious people. 79. My favorite colors are blue and dark green. 80. I hate yellow, period. Unless it's a sunny day. That's the only thing that should be yellow. 81. I am pro-choice. I don't think other people should have the right to tell a person what to do with his/her life. 82. I do not enjoy answering the phone at work. At home is a different story. 83. I get frustrated when I don't know the answer to a question. 84. I can be very impatient sometimes (no kidding - I couldn't wait a week for my car!) 85. I think the 80s was a great time to be growing up. Kids these days grow up way too fast. 86. I think cloning humans is immoral and just a bad idea in general. Nothing good could come of it. 87. I believe in guardian angels - my Nana and Uncle Aidan keep very busy looking out for my family and I. 88. I don't disbelieve in ghosts, reincarnation, and aliens. 89. I believe there is a God, but that's about as detailed as I'm often willing to go about my religious beliefs. Give me a drink or two, and that might change though. =) 90. I think most people are essentially good, but there are always bad seeds. 91. I believe evil does exist. How can you have one without the other? =) 92. I love writing for personal use - journals, blogs, etc. Otherwise, I'm not terribly creative. 93. I have been told I have excellent technical writing skills. 94. I used to play and teach the piano. I hope to re-acquaint myself with it again one day. 95. I'm an excellent speller. I wish we had spelling bees and competitions when I was in grade school. 96. My mum once had to speed from a swimming competition in one city to a musical awards ceremony in our hometown so I could attend both events. I was barely 10 years old, and at the top of my game. =) 97. I can do anything I put my mind to - the trick is sticking with it. =) 98. I love going to the gym and working out, but I also love my "down time". 99. I believe people are only victims if they allow themselves to be. 100. I think it's time to go home now! =) Awww . . . Christmas season is over, and NOW the snow comes! That was awfully disappointing - not getting a white Christmas. Add that in with the late (and sparse) shopping and no decorations at home . . . it just didn't quite feel much like Christmas this year. Well, there's always next year to look forward to. =) And now it's back to the grind. Sort of. One full day today, a half day tomorrow, then Wednesday will be spent nursing a hangover, I'm sure . . . and back to work again on Thursday and Friday. The most frustrating part is I have work that needs to get done, but I can't do much without getting information from other people, and they're all off on holidays! Not to mention that I've been expected to handle all the phone calls for the last week (and this week), and well as keep track of who's here and who's not (for the purpose of transferring calls, as not everyone has their voice mail set up). Sometimes I wonder how we actually make money, things are so disorganized around here . . . =) But enough about work . . . I'm going to babble about my car now! =) Yes, I finally got it. I was immensely disappointed when I realized I wouldn't get it in time for Christmas. But no worries - the time passed by quickly enough. The day I went to pick it up was so busy! It took an hour and a half to get all the paperwork straight and finally drive away. Then I had to drop off the car I'd been borrowing for the last 2 weeks, which was almost across the city. Since I wasn't comfortable driving in traffic (OK, driving at all), my boyfriend had the pleasure of being its first driver. And he was quite impressed . . . it's only a little 115-hp Civic engine , but it's pretty peppy. And decently roomy, too. =) So on with the story . . . You'll remember (or did I mention it?) that I bought a 5-speed when all I've ever driven is an automatic. I've always wanted to know how to drive one, and I figured this would be a good way to force me to learn. Yes, I'm warped. =) Anyways, I decided I was more comfortable practicing in the neighbourhood around his place, since it was more familiar. So we drove back across the city and spent the next hour or so with me creeping around and trying to avoid traffic. =) The few times someone came up behind me, or that I was faced with traffic when turning, I'd panic. Especially with someone behind me. I was still very slow at starting from a dead stop, which meant if there was any sort of slope to the road, I'd be rolling backwards until I got going. But it didn't take me long to feel where the clutch engaged (or is it disengaged?), so I got a little quicker at that. After a couple of missteps, I decided I needed a break to try and steady my nerves. Sadly, I never went out again because we had places to go and I still didn't want to drive in regular traffic. Then Sunday rolled around, with it's foot of fresh snow. I was happy about finally getting snow, but not that I'd have to worry about winter driving on top of still learning to drive a stick. So my boyfriend drove us around town again. =) Went to see Lord of the Rings . . . good movie. I couldn't believe how packed the theatre was, considering it was 11:30 on a Sunday morning, and there'd been a foot of snow. But we got there early enough, and it was a pretty good movie. After all was said and done, I didn't do any more driving, which made me a little nervous, since I'd be driving myself to work the next morning. Well, as you can tell, I obviously made it to work in one piece. =) Only one stall (after I nearly rear-ended someone - yikes!), from which I recovered quite nicely. I won't mention that the drive to work is barely 5km. =) I had jello legs by the time I got to work, but I'm here. =) I think at lunch, I'm going to make the trip to and from again, just to get in the practice. Ohhhh . . . too many people are calling this morning! Now there's just New Years', and then the most-hyped holiday season of the year will be over. That's OK though, cuz there will be plenty for me to look forward to in the new year . . . =) I hope everyone had a wonderful Christmas! =) I know it's been my best one in quite a few years . . . Busy though! My boyfriend has a huge family compared to mine, and they're all quite close. So the first stop on Christmas Eve was his father's. After a couple hours of noshing and visiting and opening a few presents (I couldn't believe there were two for me there!), it was off to one of his aunt's for more noshing and visiting. It was actually a good thing that there wasn't an entire meal at either stop. I don't think I would have made it home without exploding if there was! =) But it was great visiting with so many people. Christmas morning saw us back at his aunt's for breakfast - but not before opening our stockings for each other. =) After breakfast was a visit with his mum and more presents! And finally it was time to visit my family. Luckily, they were all gathered at my mum's, so it only involved one stop. =) I was frantically wrapping presents at the last minute, and even attaching name cards after I got there. So there was yet another round of presents. I got so many cool things this year, and things I really want & need! I'm so lucky . . . I also got to see my grandpa and aunt and uncle, whom I love to see, but rarely make the effort to visit during the year. I just can't wait until next year. I'm determined that next year I'll be able to do more Christmas shopping, and have the time and/or resources to help out those less fortunate as well. I have fond memories from my teenage years of taking home paper angels from the Christmas tree at Church, and buying gifts for the people on the angel. I also had great fun "shopping" in the church hall, filling boxes according to family size for those would have a hard time feeding themselves and their children over the holidays. Whenever I'm tempted to think I'm having a rough time, I remember doing those things, and the unspeakable gratitude in the eyes of the people who received something as simple as a box full of food. And suddenly I feel incredibly blessed. =) MERRY CHRISTMAS EVERYONE!! Finally, a productive weekend . . . Saturday finally saw me Christmas shopping at 9:30 in the morning. I'm glad I went early, even though it meant yet another weekend without sleeping in. The mall was empty for the most part, and I was done within an hour and a half. I'm sure I'll be doing a few last-minute things tonight or tomorrow, but that's OK - the most important stuff is done. And I bought a car on Saturday!!!! I don't actually have it yet, because it wasn't in stock. But hopefully before Christmas, at the latest within a week. I bought myself a trusty old Honda Civic. Well, not old - a 2003, to be exact. With some of the nicer doodads (power windows, CD player, keyless entry, A/C, etc), but not the fully loaded version. My boyfriend was actually very impressed with me - after a week of watching me take all the salesmen's pitches and crap and being spineless, he was quite shocked when I started pushing this last salesman around. =) I felt kinda bad, but after the week I had, I wasn't about to put up with anymore bull. I knew what I wanted, how much I wanted to pay for it, and that I wanted it ASAP. He'll be getting a very nice Christmas card from me. =) Sunday was Christmas brunch with a few friends. Good eats and good company. =) It was sad that a few people couldn't make it, but with it being so close to Christmas, that's to be expected. Everyone's got family obligations this time of year. I can't believe it's a New Year in just over a week . . . I know it'll hold some interesting (and hopefully good!) times . . . It has been a long week. I'm looking forward to the break over Christmas. So many big issues to deal with at once. Well, big for me, anyways. And the cars are only part of it. I read other peoples' blogs lately, and feel ashamed that something that is essentially a material issue has taken on such importance in my life. There are far worse things I could be dealing with. I'm looking forward to seeing my family over Christmas. Another thing I'm ashamed of - all my mum's family (except for an uncle I haven't seen since I was a child) lives in the same city as me. Two aunts and their husbands, and more recently, my grandpa. And apart from when my mum was in the hospital over the summer and at Christmas, I really don't see them at all. It's not that I can't stand them . . . I'd love to see them more often. I just don't make it a priority. Sometimes I can be a very selfish and self-centered person . . . Well, I'd better find a more cheery note on which to finish this entry . . . It's Friday! =) We're off at noon to have a little Christmas party, we're getting bonusses after all, which means I can actually afford to do my meager Christmas shopping after all. Everything else will work itself out. =) More car stories for today . . . Yesterday was the "big night". I went out in the evening with the intention of buying, and hopefully driving something new by the weekend. I was a tad sidetracked. At work, I was told that the company had fleet deals through a certain dealership, so I decided it wouldn't hurt to visit there first. Might as well see if fleet deals would get me a better price. An hour and a half later - and only a half hour before my original dealership would close - I left empty handed, frustrated, and confused. I will never deal with them again. The salesmen had tried to sell me a Pontiac when I wanted a Chevy, a GT (most expensive package, for those who aren't car-savvy) when I was pretty sure all I could afford was maybe an upgraded base model, and wouldn't talk numbers until I'd been there for an hour. I went in knowing what my price range was, and the first numbers he gave me were over $100 more. He wasted my time. So I sped back to my original Chevy dealership in the hopes that my salesman would still deal with me. He gave me a better deal without much/any haggling from me, and without me even mentioning "fleet pricing". He knew my price range, and while I'd decided I wanted more bells and whistles, was doing his best to accomodate what I wanted. Unfortunately, I didn't feel comfortable signing that night. I wanted the upgrade package, but wanted to double-check if I could afford it. So he offered to round up a base and an upgraded model for me the next day so I could physically see what it was I was buying, and could hopefully make a decision. He's guaranteed my business for years to come. And the business of my boyfriend, who said the guy was way more patient with me that he would have been. =) I tend to agree. Ohhh, late breaking news folks. I'm enjoying playing this game. =) I just got a call from the company dealership - they don't want to lose my business. I got asked what I was being offered at the other place, told that they'll beat that, and would I give them a chance? We'll see how this plays out over the course of the day. =) Anyways . . . I'm still in a battle over the broken car that started this whole fiasco. Today's project is to call BBB to find out what my rights are, or if I even have any, before I go ahead and start being pushy (me? pushy? that'll be interesting *L*). I feel like such a cheapskate lately. While I'm sure all of my bargaining lately is legit, it still makes me feel cheap. I'm trying to get money back on my broken car. I'm haggling over the price of a new car.

said because the shop is holding my car, there isn't much they can do. Read: pay them what they want, and then fight to get it back. Well, when I don't have the money in the first place, how the hell do you propose I do that? The suggestion was made (I won't mention by whom) to find the spare key and simply drive off with the car. As angry as I am, I do not want a criminal charge added to my woes. My plan at the moment (and it changes every few minutes) is to drive down there, ask for my car, and tell them to charge the repairs to my Petro-Can card. And drive off fast. Because it'll get declined. I said $300 was all I was paying for a very good reason - it was how much room I had left on my Petro-Canada card. Which would put me $3000 total in the hole for a car that I could only hopefully sell for that much. Hopefully being the operative word. I don't even know for sure yet that it's going to run once I take it home. Knowing my luck, and the track record with the shop, I'll probably get it home and it'll be clunking again. But after just long enough for them to be able to say "Well, it was working when we test-drove it." Maybe I should call in to the police and say it's stolen .
