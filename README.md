## Proposal 

Nondescript: A Web Tool to Aid Subversion of Authorship Attribution

A person’s writing style is uniquely quantifiable and can serve reliably as a biometric. A writer who wishes to remain anonymous can use a number of privacy technologies but can still be identified simply by the words they choose to use — how often they use the word “of,” for instance. Nondescript is a web tool designed first to identify the most salient features of a given writing sample and document, then to suggest how the author can change their document to lessen its probability of being attributed to them. While Nondescript does not guarantee anonymity, the web tool provides a user with an iterative interface to revise their writing and see results of a basic classifier. The classifier is trained on their provided writing sample and a set of web documents from known authors, then tested on the user’s new document and more texts from the same known authors. Nondescript also provides a synonym-replacement feature, which significantly lowers the probability that a document will be attributed to the original author, though sometimes at the cost of losing or changing meaning.
