# Nondescript 

Work toward a computational linguistics thesis submitted spring 2016 by Robin Davis (robincamilledavis@gmail.com).
=======
This is my **very much in-progress** thesis work, spring 2016. Final code repo expected June 2016.

## Proposal 

Nondescript: A Web Tool to Aid Subversion of Authorship Attribution

A person’s writing style is uniquely quantifiable and can serve reliably as a biometric. A writer who wishes to remain anonymous can use a number of privacy technologies but can still be identified simply by the words they choose to use — how often they use the word “of,” for instance. Nondescript is a web tool designed first to identify the user’s writing style (in terms of word frequency) from a given writing sample and document, then guide the author to make iterative changes to their document to lessen its probability of being attributed to them. While Nondescript does not guarantee anonymity, the web tool provides a user with an iterative interface to revise their writing and see results of a simulated authorship attribution scenario. Nondescript also provides a synonym-replacement feature, which significantly lowers the probability that a document will be attributed to the original author.
