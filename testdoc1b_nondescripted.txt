(something i should have thought twice  *** approximately ***  before  *** actually ***  undertaking), i caught the end of astroboy on nickelodeon (a show i adored as a kid), which  *** constitute ***  followed by  *** some ***  guff called totally  *** spy ***  . now,  *** there ***   *** constitute ***   *** two ***   *** significant ***   *** remainder ***  between these  *** two ***  shows; the

with a completely  *** raw ***   *** conclusion ***  to the show,  *** complete ***  with  *** raw ***  music. totally  *** spy ***  , however,  *** Washington ***  a flashy,  *** new ***  piece of  *** garbage ***  with cutting-edge  *** animation ***  and flawless appeal.  *** yet ***  somehow it lacked the  *** More ***   *** subtle ***   *** appeal ***  of astroboy ; namely, plot. well,  *** there ***   *** embody ***  a plot, and  *** here ***  it is:  *** three ***  'new-age'  *** girl ***   *** must ***   *** save ***  the  *** worldly_concern ***  from disillusioned supermodel who  *** want ***  to 'modelise' an  *** army ***  to take  *** all_over ***  the  *** fashion ***   *** diligence ***  that spurned her. the  *** world ***  is in  *** danger ***  why? because! it's... ummm... well, you know... she  *** speak ***  with an  *** English ***  accent, dammit! oh, and the uber-cutelings  *** bequeath ***   *** lose ***  their  *** delicate ***   *** feature ***  and

*** result ***  of their 'modelisation' (which  *** seem ***   *** foreign ***  since the victims  *** embody ***  ugly, but i found that  *** quite ***  hilariously ironic); they  *** be ***  stuck with freckly skin,  *** crimson ***  hair,  *** brace ***  and 'stocky' legs. that's right; not  *** fat ***  ,  *** precisely ***  stocky. but boy, you should see the  *** fuck ***   *** fuss ***  these chicks  *** place ***  on. now, i found this interesting, because their 'robust'  *** leg ***   *** exist ***  not useless, nor flabby; they  *** cost ***  in fact, super-strong. but that is of no  *** interest ***  to these uber-cuties, who  *** want ***  their slim, trim, stick-like  *** leg ***  back, because despite their tone and strength, the  *** new ***  ones don't fit into the

 *** glare ***   *** off ***  those horrible braces. *frumple* i would have thought that any self-respecting  *** individual ***  would  *** resist ***  this  *** kind ***  of  *** obscene ***  crap.

 *** secondhand ***  the  *** Bible ***  'kobold' or 'goblin'. these kinds of words  *** be ***  well-established and  *** constitute ***   *** probable ***   *** plunder ***  from another  *** source ***  in any case. usually, as you have discovered, from  *** culture ***   *** early ***  than anglo-saxon. and i'm  *** actually ***   *** change ***  the  *** discussion ***  slightly in any case; djinni is the  *** proper ***  noun in  *** wholly ***  the  *** early ***  cases; in mine, 'djinn' is the noun, and 'djinni' is a  *** specific ***  plural. thus, the  *** two ***  words  *** cost ***  different,  *** even ***  if slightly. as you  *** can ***  see, i'm not too  *** concerned ***  with 'copyright' or  *** step ***  on anyone's  *** toe ***  here.  *** matchless ***   *** word ***  i  *** do ***  out-and-out flog, which is  *** notice ***  specifically at the end of my story, is the  *** word ***  ghola , from  *** Frank ***  herbert's dune  *** series ***  (notably the

along ***  the lines of a  *** reconstruct ***  of  *** revive ***   *** genic ***  material. my  *** version ***  is magical, and isn't a big part in the story; i  *** just ***   *** love ***  the

concern ***  which  *** aspect ***   *** constitute ***  supportable  *** compare ***  to those  *** less ***  so. these shall be discussed at my convenience, as i “cannot be stuffed”  *** spending ***  the time  *** dress ***  the  *** mental ***  gymnastics to  *** change ***  my  *** watch ***  on the subject. i merely  *** wish ***  to  *** harass ***   *** argument ***  and  *** rattle ***

date ***  is the 7th, which is a saturday. have no  *** fear ***   *** about ***   *** miss ***  it.  *** fair ***  make  *** certain ***  that your hard  *** disk ***  is  *** pretty ***  organised,

***  ad&d  *** actor ***   *** knock ***  on your  *** door ***   *** once ***  they  *** notice ***  the  *** use ***  of their  *** word ***  for genie as your  *** use ***  of the  *** Son ***  for the elves. i would  *** argue ***  that it is perhaps in the  *** Lapp ***   *** kingdom ***  as  *** use ***  the  *** term ***  ‘istari’ – the wizards from tolkien’s world. i  *** sleep_together ***  the  *** word ***  sounds  *** cool ***  but you might have  *** conflict ***  because of it. i figure if perhaps the ad&d  *** multitude ***  hadn’t already  *** use ***  the  *** discussion ***  genie in the phonetic  *** spell ***  of djinni, you might have got  *** away ***  with it. i reckon,  *** fight ***  the  *** Bible ***  and make a  *** new ***   *** word ***  of your own for it. personally, i  *** think ***  the  *** connection ***  is interesting, but the  *** term ***   *** practice ***  may  *** cause ***  you trouble. genies  *** be ***  in a  *** sense ***  slaves, bound to their flask until  *** some ***  unweary adventurer sets them free. i  *** presuppose ***  this is  *** very ***   *** much ***   *** wish ***  your  *** extremely_low_frequency ***  since they  *** be ***  bound in the beginning and  *** equal ***   *** now ***  set free. i don’t  *** know ***  how others  *** will ***   *** interpret ***  the  *** connection ***  since the  *** term ***  genie (spelled: djinni) is so well known. something you might find  *** interesting ***   *** about ***  a  *** secondary ***   *** use ***  of the  *** term ***  djinni is it’s  *** function ***  in the koran, the muslim bible. it reads: djinni - (islam) an invisible  *** spirit ***   *** note ***  in the koran and  *** believe ***  by muslims to  *** inhabit ***  the  *** ground ***  and  *** influence ***  mankind by  *** appear ***  in the form of humans or animals perhaps you might be  *** able ***  to  *** use ***  that instead. it is a  *** different ***   *** meaning ***  of the  *** word ***  and well, if you  *** merely ***   *** like ***  the  *** Son ***  this  *** leave ***  you  *** practice ***  of it, without  *** rending ***   *** murder ***  anything that many  *** people ***  would  *** know ***  of. except muslims, but they  *** constitute ***  a  *** minority ***  [note the irony]. my agendas: well, i had a  *** great ***   *** night ***  with isobel (izzy) last night.  *** even ***  though she had to leave  *** early ***  to go  *** aside ***  with  *** acquaintance ***  the following morning, she still made the  *** attempt ***  to come  *** past ***

ultimately ***  “a  *** awaken ***  life”.  *** all ***  in all, i felt an amorous  *** connection ***   *** begin ***  to  *** grow ***  between us. where  *** once ***  light brushes of  *** body ***   *** contact ***   *** be ***  the norm, we have  *** reach ***  a  *** stagecoach ***  where we  *** toilet ***   *** comfortably ***   *** share ***  the  *** quick ***  of  *** one ***  another’s body. the  *** Union ***  of unquavering eyes,  *** laden ***  with  *** obscure ***   *** message ***  rocked the  *** very ***   *** foundation_garment ***  of my senses. i cannot  ***

monday, and i am  *** beaming ***  i got to see her  *** one ***  last time before she departed. she shall be missed. i don’t have  *** much ***  else to  *** remark ***  on as of late.  *** there ***  isn’t  *** much ***  to  *** nudge ***  my  *** mind ***  or  *** cause ***  it to  *** concentrate ***   *** now ***  that  *** holiday ***  have begun. perhaps i shall  *** ultimately ***   ***

***   *** arise ***  to hit a pub with a cute chick that might  *** even ***  outrank the footy. keep you posted. that's my life, at 3:13am. having  *** good ***  engaged in the ever-worthwhile  *** campaign ***  of reading dissenter's opinion, i  *** bequeath ***  direct any  *** lector ***  of this post to the aformentioned article.  *** most ***  of the discussion in this  *** textbook ***   *** will ***  be referrent to the  *** one ***  previous, and though i  *** will ***   *** attempt ***  to  *** bring ***  relevant exerpts to light, it would be useful to  *** read ***  dissenter's own words first. on the whole, i would  *** harmonize ***  with the  *** utmost ***  emphasis, with the  *** general ***   *** suggestion ***  raised by dissenter, in that an  *** understudy ***   *** solution ***  to the  *** current ***  road rules, their punishments and regulations, is necessary. i would also concur that the  *** most ***  extreme, the  *** most ***   *** reproducible ***  and the  *** most ***  reckless offenders  *** be ***  those to whom the  *** law ***  should indeed strive to punish. however, and this is the point at which i  *** will ***  begin, i do not  *** agree ***  that an immediate, all-pervasive and  *** probable ***  draconian punishment is the answer. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; why  *** put ***   *** religion ***  in the  *** value ***  of  *** conditioning ***  when it has  *** be ***  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;shown to be so falsely and weakly supportable? better to &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;remove those  *** directly ***   *** off ***  the road  *** promptly ***  before potentially &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;more  *** injury ***  takes place. the  *** opinion ***  should be the first time &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;you  *** speed ***  or break the road rules; you should  *** hurt ***  an &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;immediate  *** loss ***  of licence. no second  *** chance ***   *** incriminate ***  that &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;those that have their  *** license ***   *** bequeath ***  be  *** more ***   *** reluctant ***  to give &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;it  *** aside ***  so easily, and those that  *** be ***   *** careless ***   *** enough ***  to be &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;apathetic towards this won’t have it for  *** very ***   *** hanker ***  – and &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;rightly so. i would in  *** all ***  honesty  *** ask ***  whether  *** condition ***  in  *** gaze ***  to the punishment of  *** fin ***  has  *** actually ***   *** be ***   *** show ***  to  *** fail ***  in the  *** majority ***  of cases. it may be that in many cases  *** condition ***  does not work immediately, if at all, and that it is not a  *** complete ***  answer to the  *** problem ***  of reckless or  *** careless ***  driving. however, as a  *** general ***  deterrent, i would  *** think ***  it works  *** quite ***  well. i would point out that it may in  *** fact ***   *** fail ***  the  *** majority ***  of times in  *** extreme_point ***  cases such as that  *** draft ***  by dissenter, but it is not these  *** extreme_point ***  cases it sets out to deter in the first place. but,  *** presume ***  this is an  *** article ***  against  *** peculiarly ***   *** deficient ***  and negligent drivers, i  *** will ***   *** assume ***  that the point is moot, and  *** count ***  at the  *** following ***  case in hand; the  *** immediate ***  refusal of  *** license ***  for first offenders. this, i  *** must ***  say, would be completely inappropriate. both the  *** severity ***  and swiftness of punishment might well deter  *** most ***   *** driver ***  from  *** rush ***  and/or infringing, but it  *** will ***  not stop those, who as dissenter  *** most ***  adequately  *** state ***  himself, have a  *** contempt ***  or  *** ignore ***  for the law,  *** just ***  as  *** discipline ***   *** volition ***  not. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; if it is done this way, it  *** bequeath ***   *** qualify ***   *** repeat ***  offenders since &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;they cannot  *** continue ***  speeding, not  *** tied ***   *** just ***  a little, since &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;any  *** minor ***  infraction  *** bequeath ***   *** campaign ***   *** result ***  of licence. perhaps, but it also  *** restrict ***   *** all ***  offenders, and anyone who is caught is punished  *** just ***  as harshly, since 'any  *** minor ***  infraction  *** will ***   *** cause ***   *** end_point ***  of license'. to subject an  *** entire ***   *** company ***  to  *** peculiarly ***   *** coarse ***  or  *** rigorous ***  rules because of the idiocy of a few is ludicrous. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; whether they have  *** memorize ***  their  *** lesson ***  or not is unimportant &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;here since they  *** be ***  not given another opportunity to  *** prove ***  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;their erudition. what  *** about ***  those who have  *** memorize ***  their lesson? neither  *** be ***  they given another opportunity. i would suggest, at a minimum, that  *** trey ***   *** umbrage ***   *** occur ***  before the  *** suspension ***  of a license. the  *** police ***  is  *** about ***  precedent, and  *** trey ***   *** offense ***  is a clear  *** case_law ***  in any case. the time  *** period ***  between each should be  *** less ***  than a year;  *** after ***  all, it is a bit hard to  *** ask ***  every  *** driver ***  on the road not to err  *** more ***  than  *** once ***  in an  *** entire ***   *** year ***  or face the  *** loss ***  of a license. unfortunately, we  *** be ***   *** wholly ***   *** human ***  and make mistakes. we  *** must ***  give  *** some ***  breadth of opportunity for  *** error ***  and instead  *** focus ***  the  *** high ***   *** penalty ***  upon those who earn them. in this  *** respect ***  i would also disagree on the  *** abandonment ***  of  *** vary ***   *** penalty ***  for  *** vary ***  offenses. to  *** say ***  that an offender who  *** exceed ***  the  *** specify ***  by 5km/h in a 110  *** zone ***  is  *** just ***  as reckless as  *** one ***  who  *** exceed ***  the  *** limit ***  by 60km/h in an 80  *** zone ***  is ridiculous. because they  *** be ***  not. to  *** exceed ***  the  *** limit ***  by  *** less ***  than 5% could in  *** fact ***  be  *** write ***   *** off ***  to a momentary  *** distraction ***  or neglect; an infringement perhaps, but not  *** one ***  that deserves a  *** penalty ***  of  *** remove ***  their  *** license ***  for 3 years! on the  *** other ***  hand, to infring by such a  *** gross ***   *** margin ***  as the latter example, which  *** total ***  to a 75% excess, might well earn that penalty. i would  *** frankincense ***   *** argue ***  that the  *** current ***   *** system ***  supports this method of punishment, in an  *** ascend ***  scale. what, i think,  *** need ***  to  *** happen ***  in  *** gaze ***  to the punishment is to  *** ban ***  repeat,  *** significant ***  offenders for  *** long ***   *** menstruation ***  of time. anyone who  *** exceed ***  the  *** limit ***  by  *** over ***  50% should have their  *** license ***   *** suspend ***  immediately. to  *** recur ***  the  *** crime ***  at any time in the  *** future ***  should incur the  *** same ***  penalty, for double the duration. a  *** one-third ***   *** repeat ***  of such a  *** significant ***   *** discourtesy ***  might  *** even ***   *** render ***  the  *** driver ***  ineligible to drive again. not many  *** people ***  could  *** argue ***  that such a punishment is unreasonable; such  *** excess ***  is no accident. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the road to getting the  *** license ***  should  *** remain ***  the same, for &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;reasons not  *** argue ***  here, but the road to keeping it should &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;be much,  *** much ***  harder.  *** approximately ***  this is because  *** genial ***  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;maturity is too difficult to  *** ass ***  at the time  *** license ***  testing. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;it cannot be  *** determine ***  prior to the accident whether this &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;individual  *** will ***  or  *** will ***  not be a road hazard. in this case, i  *** mustiness ***  completely disagree. the  *** stream ***  methods for  *** acquire ***  a road  *** license ***  in  *** Victoria ***   *** embody ***  an  *** absolute ***  joke. answer a few multiple-choice questions, press a few  *** release ***  and  *** bumble ***  your  *** direction ***   *** done ***  a  *** sterile ***  driving  *** course ***  and you have yourself a ten-year license. many  *** driver ***   *** conflict ***  to  *** identify ***   *** dim-witted ***  rules such as whose right it is to turn into a  *** street ***  first from  *** respective ***  points in an intersection; when it is  *** appropriate ***  to indicate; which lane of a road to drive in, and when. what importance is  *** actually ***  given to  *** retain ***  any knowledge of road rules  *** after ***  the test? what  *** respect ***  or  *** caution ***  is given by  *** Young ***   *** driver ***  when they pass the  *** test ***  and  *** own ***  the 'right' to drive a vehicle? the  *** restriction ***  on beginning  *** driver ***   *** embody ***   *** identical ***   *** dilute ***  and  *** only ***  barely adequate.  *** mental ***   *** maturity ***  is indeed difficult to gauge, not  *** only ***  during a fifteen-minute driving test, but at any  *** stage ***  by anyone with a  *** brief ***   *** come ***  of time in which to do so. nor is it the place of testers to  *** identify ***  whether or not a given  *** driver ***  might be a road  *** luck ***  in the future. what is  *** ask ***   *** exist ***   *** rigid ***  guidelines, and a  *** more ***  in-depth  *** routine ***  for  *** develop ***   *** license ***  in the first place; perhaps  *** tied ***   *** mandatary ***   *** refresher ***   *** course ***  or  *** test ***  in the

the  *** most ***  excessive amounts, and the  *** about ***  regularly. statistics by  *** versatile ***   *** government ***  and  *** private ***   *** company ***  show the  *** most ***   ***

25. it is not surprising, in light of the accident  *** delineate ***  in dissenter's article, upon  *** far ***   *** detail ***  to find that the  *** fomite ***  driven  *** be ***  modified. i would ask: what  *** symmetry ***  of serious,  *** frequent ***  offenders  *** are ***  not  *** only ***  in the first of these brackets, but also driving  *** change ***  or  *** particularly ***   *** mighty ***  vehicles? i would therefore  *** suggest ***  that the  *** culture ***  of  *** vehicle ***   *** modification ***  is a  *** significant ***  contributor to the  *** causal_agent ***  of  *** serious ***  road  *** injury ***  and fatalities. i would also  *** suggest ***  that the  *** demand ***  made on  *** hand_truck ***   *** driver ***   *** over ***   *** long ***   *** period ***  of time  *** due ***  to inappropriately short  *** need ***  times is another  *** meaning ***  contributor to road  *** injury ***  and/or fatality. in the case of the latter, it might be as  *** bare ***  as gearing  *** union ***  to achieve workplace  *** standard ***  or instituting  *** regulation ***  for  *** minimum ***   *** locomotion ***  times for long-distance  *** truck ***   *** driver ***   *** embedded ***  in legislation. in the case of the former, it  *** seem ***  that the  *** identical ***   *** culture ***  of the individuals  *** involved ***   *** will ***  be  *** much ***  harder to  *** erase ***  or positively modify. unfortunately, not  *** all ***  those who  *** modify ***   *** car ***   *** be ***  'hoons'. many are, but not all. to crack down on the  *** integral ***   *** acculturation ***  would be  *** peculiarly ***  unfair on those who  *** love ***   *** modified ***   *** vehicle ***  but who also obey and  *** deference ***  the law. i would  *** suggest ***   *** great ***   *** restrict ***  on  *** senesce ***  and  *** experience ***  for  *** allow ***   *** certain ***   *** vehicle ***  to be driven, or  *** even ***  owned, by  *** detail ***  individuals in  *** certain ***   *** historic_period ***  brackets. no  *** doubt ***  these  *** regulation ***  already exist, but  *** provision ***  might  *** motivation ***  to be made to  *** more ***  effectively reduce the  *** capacity ***  of  *** repeat ***  offenders to own or drive such vehicles. i would  *** propose ***  that  *** far ***   *** more ***   *** significant ***   *** fin ***  and,  *** more ***  appropriately,  *** restriction ***  be placed on  *** young ***   *** male ***  with  *** change ***  vehicles,  *** repeat ***  offenders, and  *** good ***  offenders. although it is in the best  *** sake ***  of everyone to keep 'road-maniacs'  *** murder ***  the road, where they belong, it is also a  *** count ***  of  *** balance ***   *** more ***   *** hard ***   *** penalty ***  with those of  *** less ***  offenders, who may have made  *** simple ***   *** err ***  or  *** are ***   *** quite ***   *** adequate_to ***  of  *** change ***  their ways. in any case: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; if you cannot  *** wield ***  your  *** car ***  and  *** cost ***  a  *** luck ***  on the road, &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;then you should not be  *** allow ***  to  *** continue ***  driving. this is the point  *** beyond ***   *** dispute ***  here, and no  *** topic ***  what may or may not be the

***   *** application ***  of  *** austere ***  retribution. the  *** driver ***  of that  *** vehicle ***  does not deserve to drive again, but does deserve the  *** pain ***  and guilt he may well

turned into a quadriplegic. sitting in the passenger seat of his friend’s hotted-up vehicle, they  *** collide ***  head on with another  *** car ***  while driving  *** over ***  160 km/h on a dark,

in  *** intensive ***   *** wish ***   *** fight ***  to keep his ability to walk again if not his life. what  *** constitute ***  we to do to prevent such  *** calamity ***  from taking place? who is to  *** blame ***  for the catastrophe? many  *** possible ***   *** solution ***  and  *** counter ***   *** controversy ***  present themselves.  *** Lashkar-e-Taiba ***  us  *** begin ***  this first by  *** tax ***   *** blasted ***  by the parents.  *** show ***  that  *** firm ***  parenting is not a suitable  *** solution ***  to the problem, i shall  *** ass ***   *** possible ***  changes to the road  *** jurisprudence ***  that  *** govern ***  whom may be  *** afford ***  the  *** luxury ***  of driving automobiles.  *** use ***   *** two ***   *** elementary ***  and  *** common ***  cases of road  *** law ***  infringement, i shall show that it is illogical to  *** stay ***  to  *** allow ***   *** insecure ***   *** driver ***  upon the road. this being the case the  *** problem ***  that  *** rise ***  with the  *** controversy ***   *** be ***   *** show ***  not to be flawed when  *** see ***  independently of  *** other ***   *** factor ***  but could turn out to be potentially disastrous for the  *** general ***   *** smooth ***   *** operation ***  of the population. returning to the case at hand, this  *** child ***  – for that is  *** precisely ***  what he is – threw  *** caution ***  to the wind and willingly jeopardised his life. now, is this the  *** fault ***  of the child? abso-bloody-lutely. everyone is  *** responsible ***  for his or her own  *** legal_action ***  and this case shall not be  *** argue ***  against here. what  *** about ***  the parents? i would say, being  *** indulgent ***  and aware of what it is  *** alike ***  having  *** corrective ***   *** parent ***  of  *** respective ***   *** expressive_style ***  that not  *** all ***  the  *** blasted ***  should fall on them. certainly if they  *** equal ***  being  *** awful ***  role-models for their  *** child ***  –  *** expose ***  them to  *** wholly ***   *** sort ***  of bad  *** habit ***  and  *** routine ***  – the  *** child ***   *** will ***  pick up  *** some ***  of these from their day-to-day  *** vulnerability ***  to it. but this may not  *** necessarily ***  be the so in the  *** majority ***  of household operations. certainly what could mostly be  *** argue ***  is that  *** parent ***  with difficult  *** child ***  or  *** unseasoned ***  adults  *** be ***  either too apathetic to  *** caution ***   *** about ***  their child’s  *** behavior ***  or too  *** deficient ***  in control to  *** discipline ***  them  *** bequeath ***  be  *** More ***  prevalent in such road infringements. what  *** look ***  evident with both these  *** group ***  is that if the apathetic  *** parent ***   *** become ***  the  *** care ***   *** rear ***  and those that lack  *** discipline ***   *** suddenly ***  found an  *** allow ***  method of  *** manipulate ***  their children, it would not  *** guarantee ***  that their  *** child ***  would be  *** sensible ***   *** buttocks ***  the wheel. as  *** child ***   *** turn ***  they  *** gain ***  many  *** different ***   *** influence ***  – such as  *** friend ***  and  *** early ***  relatives – and so the  *** rear ***   *** toilet ***   *** only ***  set the  *** stage ***  and rehearse with  *** child ***   *** then ***   *** allow ***  them to  *** dance ***  their own  *** way ***  to the  *** distribute ***  script. with such  *** specify ***  control, a  *** parent ***   *** displace ***   *** only ***   *** promise ***  that their  *** child ***  has the  *** sense ***  to  *** act ***  in a  *** way ***  that is  *** safe ***  and appropriate, but this as a  *** fact ***  is never the  *** way ***  the case presents itself.  *** child ***   *** experiment ***  and that is a  *** fact ***  of life, but when experimentation  *** become ***  dangerous – to themselves and others –  *** then ***   *** external ***   *** intervention ***  is required. being  *** educate ***  and  *** tell ***  right from  *** incorrect ***  isn’t  *** adequate ***  anymore. the  *** law ***   *** be ***   *** design ***  to serve in the  *** concern ***  of humankind, to  *** keep ***  prosperity and sanctity of life, and this is a case that  *** most ***  strongly  *** want ***  a  *** reasonable ***  and suitable intervention. my  *** argumentation ***   *** will ***   *** seem ***  incomplete if i  *** dismiss ***  the  *** minority ***   *** group ***  of  *** parent ***  that  *** be ***   *** quite ***   *** poor ***  with their children, so to address them i make the following comment: they  *** will ***   *** most ***   *** likely ***  never change, and their  *** behavior ***   *** constitute ***  so  *** deep-rooted ***  that their  *** child ***   *** will ***  probably  *** suffer ***  by default. this is tragic, i understand, but we  *** be ***  dealing with  *** logic ***  and the  *** majority ***  of reasonable,  *** care ***  parents. to be  *** sensible ***  we should call a  *** spade ***  a  *** spade ***  and  *** understand ***  that the  *** law ***   *** buttocks ***  go  *** above ***  the idiocy or irresponsibility of  *** poor ***   *** rear ***  and this is a  *** site ***  where it is direly required. seeing as it is unreasonable to rely on the  *** Assumption ***  that, given their  *** parent ***   *** can ***  control their children, it would  *** discontinue ***  their  *** juvenile ***  and dangerous behaviour. relying on a  *** high ***  order to  *** organize ***  and  *** sustain ***  sanity and  *** protection ***  of the denizens of the  *** city ***  from such acts, we  *** embody ***   *** forced ***  to  *** recourse ***  to the law. teenagers these  *** day ***   *** equal ***  given the right to  *** learn ***  to drive a  *** car ***  from the  *** age ***  of 16 until they  *** compass ***  18 where they  *** begin ***  their probationary  *** period ***  for  *** trey ***   *** further ***  years,  *** finally ***   *** reach ***  their  *** full ***   *** license ***  at 21 (without prior offences). the  *** law ***  as it stands, and heretofore i shall  *** refer ***  to it loosely, that those breaking it  *** suffer ***   *** ticket ***   *** accord ***  to how  *** much ***  they erred.  *** let ***  us deal with  *** two ***   *** character ***  of  *** penalty ***   *** receive ***  acts:  *** travel_rapidly ***  and road  *** related ***  accidents such as collisions. firstly, i  *** regard ***  to go into  *** accelerate ***  and how such acts  *** promote ***  or  *** buttocks ***  act as a signifier of potentially hazardous drivers. the  *** law ***   *** affirm ***  that  *** generally ***  those that  *** speed ***   *** will ***  desist in their  *** campaign ***  to  *** overtake ***  the  *** speed ***   *** specify ***  if they  *** be ***   *** fin ***   *** heavily ***  and  *** suffer ***  demerit points lost  *** off ***  their licence. this  *** will ***  eventually  *** consequence ***  in  *** license ***  revocation. the  *** law ***   *** assert ***  that this  *** will ***   *** absent ***  dangerous and hazardous  *** driver ***   *** off ***  the road and  *** admit ***  for  *** dependable ***  driving. this is unjustifiable. it is as  *** irrational_number ***  as the  *** parent ***  that  *** believe ***  if they  *** scold ***  their  *** child ***  for the  *** thousandth ***  time they won’t play with matches again, or  *** pace ***   *** through ***  the  *** house ***  with  *** mud ***  on their feet, or speed. punishment and  *** regulation ***  does not  *** imply ***  that someone  *** bequeath ***   *** determine ***  their  *** moral ***  and  *** decide ***  to  *** behave ***  appropriately and sensibly  *** harmonize ***  to the law.  *** most ***   *** likely ***  it  *** volition ***  make  *** reprise ***  offenders  *** more ***   *** volatile ***  and  *** promote ***   *** contempt ***  for the  *** law ***  or anything that  *** restrict ***  them. their  *** smell ***  of wronging or punishment  *** volition ***   *** further ***  push them  *** away ***  from the  *** law ***   *** rather ***  than  *** steer ***  them in and  *** promote ***  them to  *** behave ***  appropriately.  *** even ***  if this is not the case  *** there ***  is nothing to  *** indicate ***  that they have  *** better ***  in their  *** genial ***   *** maturity ***  and  *** volition ***  from  *** then ***  onwards  *** bearing ***  to  *** behave ***  within the  *** limit ***  set by the law. why  *** place ***   *** faith ***  in the  *** prize ***  of  *** condition ***  when it has  *** cost ***   *** show ***  to be so falsely and weakly supportable? better to  *** remove ***  those  *** directly ***   *** away ***  the road  *** promptly ***  before potentially  *** more ***   *** harm ***  takes place. the  *** govern ***  should be the first time you  *** speed ***  or break the road rules; you should  *** suffer ***  an  *** contiguous ***   *** loss ***  of licence. no second  *** chance ***   *** imply ***  that those that have their  *** license ***   *** bequeath ***  be  *** More ***   *** reluctant ***  to give it  *** away ***  so easily, and those that  *** exist ***   *** careless ***   *** enough ***  to be apathetic towards this won’t have it for  *** very ***   *** long ***  – and rightly so. the road to getting the  *** license ***  should  *** stay ***  the same, for  *** reason ***  not  *** argue ***  here, but the road to keeping it should be much,  *** a_lot ***  harder.  *** roughly ***  this is because  *** mental ***   *** maturity ***  is too difficult to  *** ass ***  at the time  *** license ***  testing. it cannot be  *** determined ***  prior to the accident whether this  *** individual ***   *** will ***  or  *** will ***  not be a road hazard. the  *** alone ***  fair option, without  *** induce ***  an infringement on their rights, is to  *** allow ***  someone to have a fair go before they  *** equal ***  condemned.  *** subsequently ***  that time  *** all ***  strikes  *** reckon ***  as fatal. if it is done this way, it  *** will ***   *** restrict ***   *** reprise ***  offenders since they cannot  *** stay ***  speeding, not  *** even ***   *** merely ***  a little, since any  *** minor ***  infraction  *** bequeath ***   *** induce ***   *** termination ***  of licence. this  *** agent ***  in that the mindset of the  *** individual ***   *** indigence ***  not change across time while they  *** constitute ***  driving since as  *** long ***  as they break the  *** jurisprudence ***  they  *** will ***  be  *** off ***  the road permanently. whether they have  *** teach ***  their  *** moral ***  or not is unimportant  *** here ***  since they  *** be ***  not given another opportunity to  *** prove ***  their erudition. as  *** long ***  as they offend, the  *** law ***  should  *** stipulate ***   *** immediate ***  termination. in such a way, the reliance on  *** stipulate ***  to  *** improvement ***  via  *** fin ***  or  *** suspension ***  is forgone. to  *** become ***  realistic, it would be  *** impossible ***  to  *** end ***   *** license ***  permanently, as this would be seen as  *** condemnation ***  without revocation. what should be  *** implement ***  is sever  *** punishment ***  that, irrespective of the  *** size ***  of the  *** accelerate ***  infringement,  *** appeal ***   *** immediate ***   *** loss ***  of  *** license ***  and at  *** least ***  2 or 3 years. driving is a  *** privilege ***  by those that  *** be ***   *** worthy ***   *** enough ***  to  *** use ***  the  *** road ***  sensibly, and not a  *** privilege ***  by  *** default_option ***  as it is  *** regard ***  today. when it comes down to it,  *** ask ***  yourself whether giving a road-maniac the ability to drive again so that he or she  *** toilet ***  potentially  *** pique ***  again is  *** important ***  because it’s their right to do so or whether the  *** condom ***  of your children,  *** family ***  and  *** ally ***  is  *** more ***  important. surely, you  *** will ***   *** get_rid_of ***  the offender of the road and keep your  *** love ***  ones safe.  *** speed ***   *** specify ***   *** will ***  be  *** adhere ***  for  *** fear ***  of the  *** penalty ***  and so  *** some ***  order shall be restored, not by relying on the good  *** volition ***  and  *** teach ***  of others, but by  *** remove ***  those that  *** be ***   *** repellent ***  to such  *** eruditeness ***  from the equation. what  *** inevitably ***  to be  *** spot ***   *** here ***  is that the right to  *** enforce ***  for a  *** driver ***   *** license ***  should be  *** available ***  to everyone without discrimination, but the  *** privilege ***  to keep it should be for those that  *** embody ***   *** able ***  to  *** keep ***  and  *** prove ***  their  *** Worth ***  as a driver. this would  *** imply ***   *** little ***  or no accidents and certainly no  *** accelerate ***   *** fin ***  or reckless behaviour. such acts  *** only ***  serve to show the lackadaisical  *** attitude ***  of the  *** driver ***  and the lack of  *** discipline ***  that is essentially  *** needed ***  to  *** ride ***   *** behind ***  the  *** rack ***  safely. reasonably it would not be sane to  *** frame ***  an inexperienced suburban  *** rear ***  into  *** outer_space ***   *** after ***  a  *** week ***  of training, as although it is his right to see  *** space ***  and beyond, he is not up to the  *** challenge ***  to  *** try ***  deep  *** quad ***  voyage.  *** do ***  so is an endangerment to those working with him in the  *** cooperative ***  system.  *** right ***  and  *** privilege ***   *** be ***  mutually exclusive. you  *** displace ***  have the right to go into space, but without  *** proper ***  skill,  *** test ***  and training, you may not  *** pick_up ***  the  *** privilege ***  to go up there. the  *** other ***   *** sort ***  of dangerous  *** driver ***  is the  *** patronize ***  accidental or  *** careless ***  driver. they  *** be ***  the individuals that constantly,  *** through ***   *** fault ***  or not  *** mistake ***  of their own  *** engage ***  in accidents  *** involve ***   *** car ***  or others  *** object ***   *** along ***  the roadside. these individuals  *** equal ***  a bane to society, obviously  *** deficient ***  in their ability to  *** treat ***  their automobile safely  *** adequate ***  to keep themselves and others clear of danger. this is a  *** similar ***  case to  *** accelerate ***  since it  *** can ***  be caused  *** due ***  to carelessness; lack of  *** attention ***  to the  *** task ***  at hand,  *** inadequate ***   *** education ***  and  *** coordination ***  and  *** diverse ***   *** other ***  reasons. the  *** argument ***  to  *** remove ***  these  *** driver ***   *** off ***  the road also  *** root ***  from the aforementioned case of if they aren’t on the road, they can’t  *** lawsuit ***  a problem. this  *** seem ***   *** coherent ***  enough. why keep someone who is  *** insecure ***  on the road at all? they should be  *** remove ***  leaving the law-abiding citizens to drive in  *** peace ***  and safety. until such time as they  *** can ***  be  *** show ***  to be  *** safe ***  on the road again when they  *** be ***   *** show ***  to be  *** safe ***  and  *** knowing ***  in their  *** vehicle ***  method of  *** operations ***  –  *** through ***  a driving  *** clinic ***  for  *** case ***  – they should be reprimanded from  *** farther ***  driving activity. driving is a  *** privilege ***  not a right – something that has  *** be ***   *** forget ***  in the  *** interest ***  of  *** government ***  income and revenue. the  *** Lapp ***   *** use ***  with driving dangerously. if you cannot  *** wield ***  your  *** car ***  and  *** be ***  a  *** gamble ***  on the road,  *** then ***  you should not be  *** allow ***  to  *** proceed ***  driving. my  *** aim ***  from both of these  *** deuce ***  cases is to point out that taking the  *** agent ***  out of the  *** situation ***  would serve as the best  *** think_of ***  of a solution. a  *** driver ***  who  *** speed ***  does not  *** regard ***  the  *** prerogative ***  of driving and so it is  *** deny ***  it. similarly, a  *** driver ***  who is dangerous on the road and a  *** causal_agent ***  of continuous accidents should also be  *** take_out ***  since they  *** embody ***  not  *** apt ***   *** adequate ***  to  *** handle ***  themselves on the road in a  *** safe ***  manor. these  *** simpleton ***   *** thing ***   *** displace ***   *** salvage ***  lives but  *** there ***  is  *** always ***  something that  *** cause ***  the  *** position ***  to  *** become ***   *** more ***  complicated. likely, the  *** government ***  would stop making  *** money ***  if  *** people ***  that  *** be ***   *** travel_rapidly ***   *** be ***  to be taken  *** off ***  the road and so would  *** resist ***  such a drastic  *** result ***  process. also, the  *** sheer ***   *** volume ***  of  *** driver ***  to be  *** suspended ***  would be so high that it would possibly destroy, if not  *** badly ***   *** damage ***   *** enterprise ***  since  *** people ***  would not be  *** able ***  to arrive to work any more. it might also  *** increase ***  a sporadic crime  *** wave ***  of  *** cable_car ***  thefts, unlicensed driving, and joy-riding by those that have had their  *** license ***  revoked, possibly  *** command ***   *** more ***  policing in that  *** particular ***  area. these  *** possible ***   *** situation ***   *** seem ***  evident and  *** even ***   *** highly ***  likely, but at what  *** cost ***   *** constitute ***  we to keep the lives of your  *** child ***  and  *** syndicate ***  safe?  *** remove ***  idiots  *** off ***  the road serves to keep those on the road safe, but the  *** effect ***  on the  *** community ***   *** indigence ***  to be  *** weigh ***  also. but this  *** can ***   *** stay ***  for another discussion. adew all. dissenter i don't  *** need ***  dictionary.com. i am dictionary.com. hey,

of hyper-intellectual forum for dissecting the nuances of the  *** human ***  dichotomy, but if that  *** rock_'n'_roll ***  your boat,  *** then ***  it certainly  *** can ***  be. i  *** determine

*** quite ***  watchable, but as  *** Army_for_the_Liberation_of_Rwanda ***  as an  *** disclose ***  goes, this fell flat on its boof-head face. it wasn't anything out of the ordinary, nor anything

***   *** sit_down ***  at home in  *** front ***  of your two-hundred-inch  *** plasma ***  and  *** delight ***  the  *** replay ***  of your last  *** belt ***  by collingwood, is my  *** response ***  to that. so that's my pop  *** segment ***  for this week. hi. this is a blog  *** entrance ***  from angela. everything on this  *** site ***   *** seem ***   *** intellectual ***  and you  *** all ***   *** spell ***  with big words but i dont. so ner. im breaking the rhythem. i dont  *** flush ***   *** acknowledge ***  how to  *** spell ***  rythem and im too lazy to dictionary.com it. my

over. i  *** say ***  that to myself 3  *** hour ***  ago. im  *** good-for-nothing ***  if i  *** done_for ***  the  *** notion ***  of your glob blog. i'll  *** write ***   *** more ***  another time when i  *** expand ***  my vocabulary. mrs  *** marsh ***   *** say ***  that i  *** want ***  to  *** extend ***  it byebye! consider: if someone is intimidated, they  *** cost ***  made to  *** suffer ***   *** intimidation ***  against their will. if someone is intimated , would they not be suffering intimacy, also against their will? i find it interesting, in that context, to take a  *** expect ***  at  *** some ***  of the  *** effects ***  of such activity, as  *** explain ***  in  *** common ***   *** American_English ***  by the thesaurus of  *** about ***  scumsoft products.  *** write ***  'intimated' into any  *** word ***  document,  *** use ***  the thesaurus (shift-f7), and be  *** perplex ***  at the  *** effect ***  of being made intimate...  *** one ***  no  ***

***   *** nature ***  of our language. it's my birthday and i'll blog if i  *** lack ***  to! i  *** sexual_love ***  this story. it has  *** wholly ***  the  *** necessity ***   *** part ***  of a good read: intrigue, betrayal,  *** murder ***  and  *** fail ***  romance.  *** real ***   *** love_story ***  is for amateurs;  *** only ***  a master  *** can ***   *** appropriate ***  the grotesqueries of the  *** most ***   *** twist ***  romances. it has a  *** capital ***  hero, jason, of the  *** paper_nautilus ***  and  *** fortunate ***   *** fleece ***  fame,  *** nowadays ***  reduced considerably in the  *** admiration ***  of she  *** once ***  his concubine. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; you  *** dirty ***  coward! - if i  *** know ***  any worse name &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;for such unmanliness i'd  *** function ***  it - so, you've come! &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;you, my worst enemy, come to me! oh, it's not courage, &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;this  *** look ***   *** acquaintance ***  in the face  *** after ***   *** cheat_on ***  them. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;it's not  *** even ***  audacity; it's a disease. to  *** save ***  her love, medea  *** sacrifice ***  everything; her home, her father, her sisters, and  *** traveled ***  back to corinth with jason.  *** two ***   *** child ***  and a  *** bitter ***   *** relationship ***  later, he has forsaken her to marry the daughter of creon,  *** king ***  of corinth. now,  *** let ***   *** there ***  be no  *** doubt ***  in anyone's  *** mind ***  that medea is hard . she's a twisted,  *** bitter ***  bitch, but i  *** sexual_love ***  that  *** approximately ***  her. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; what makes me  *** cry ***  with  *** pain ***  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;is the  *** adjacent ***   *** thing ***  i have to do. i  *** volition ***  kill my sons. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;no  *** matchless ***  shall take my  *** child ***  from me. when i have made &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;jason's  *** whole ***   *** house ***  a shambles, i  *** will ***  leave corinth &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;a murderess, flying from my  *** beloved ***  children's blood. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;yes, i  *** buttocks ***   *** weather ***  guilt,  *** however ***  horrible; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the laughter of my  *** enemy ***  i  *** will ***  not endure. she ends up having her vengeance upon jason, who in this tale  *** appear ***   *** fairly ***  chauvanistic and simple. medea, on the  *** other ***  hand, is  *** very ***  complex; she  *** sexual_love ***  and  *** hat ***  the man, and  *** struggle ***  with the  *** moral ***  dilemma before her,  *** finally ***  giving in to the  *** urge ***  to do what i  *** be ***   *** die ***  for her to do for the  *** entire ***   *** distance ***  of the plot:  *** unleash ***  the fury. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  *** sleeve ***  yourself, my heart: the  *** matter ***  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;that you  *** must ***  do is fearful,  *** even ***  inevitable. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;why  *** expect ***  then? my accursed hand, come, take the sword; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;take it, and  *** ahead ***  to your  *** frontier ***  of despair. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;no cowardice, to tender memories;  *** forget ***  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;that you  *** once ***   *** loved ***  them, that of your  *** body ***  they  *** be ***  born. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;for  *** one ***  short  *** day ***   *** forget ***  your children; afterwards &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;weep: though you kill them, they  *** constitute ***  your beloved sons. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;life has  *** be ***  cruel to me.  *** now ***  that is willpower. euripides  *** sure ***  had a fair  *** previous ***  imagination, because he  *** dream ***  up  *** some ***   *** pretty ***   *** barbarian ***  stuff.  *** people ***   *** much ***   *** order ***  that  *** ferocity ***  on  *** television_receiver ***  is  *** laying_waste ***   *** young ***  minds, but by that rationale,  *** new ***   *** ancient ***  greeks should have  *** equal ***  homicidal maniacs, the  *** distribute ***  of them. tragedy and  *** mangle ***   *** be ***   *** lay ***  before them constantly in their amphitheatres, which  *** be ***  the television, radio, cinema and mcg of their day. but no  *** mention ***  of medea  *** can ***  go without my  *** favorite ***  quote,  *** one ***  of my all-time  *** most ***  precious; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  *** get ***  no  *** one ***   *** think ***  of me &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;as  *** humble ***  or  *** weak ***  or passive;  *** Lashkar-e-Taiba ***  them  *** sympathize ***  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;i am of a  *** unlike ***  kind: dangerous to my enemies, &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;loyal to my friends. to such a  *** liveliness ***   *** glory ***  belongs. and that is the  *** beauty ***  of medea.  *** three ***  points: i : good call, my  *** Young ***  padawan. a timelier piece could not have  *** equal ***  constructed, unless of course, it had anything to do with  *** stream ***  affairs, such as israel-palestine, the us-australia free  *** trade ***  agreement, or mark latham's plethora of prior  *** rape ***  charges, to name a few. but,  *** wholly ***   *** thing ***  being considered, this  *** rank ***  right up there. ii :  *** due ***  to his being called 'the  *** muscleman ***  from brussels', i have a fair  *** mind ***  where this 'kraut' is from. iii : i think, to  *** put ***  it plainly, we should  *** install ***   *** some ***  ground-rules here. namely, that  *** approximately ***   *** sense ***  of decency and etiquette should be maintained. therefore, i have to  *** ask ***  what the fuck you  *** be ***  thinking when you  *** suffice ***  your random question. have  *** some ***   *** fuck ***  class, man.  *** other ***  than that, spiffy, my friend. spiffy indeed.  *** welcome ***  to the first of many 'stating the obvious'. this  *** workweek ***  we shall  *** look ***  at  *** vanguard ***  damme, the muscle-bound moron from wherever. equiped with a bad  *** accent ***  and  *** even ***  worse  *** dissemble ***  skills,  *** vanguard ***  damme has  *** once ***  again  *** attempted ***  to take his skills seriously with the  *** action ***   *** flick ***  "derailed". the words "what the-" and "that makes no sense" may constantly  *** flood ***  into your  *** take_care ***  as you  *** spend ***  your  *** valuable ***  time attempting to  *** understand ***  the  *** plot ***  - which in  *** fact ***  doesn't exist. okay, okay, i am being a  *** little ***  too harsh.  *** get ***   *** good ***  *assume*  *** there ***  is a viable plot, what now? we  *** constitute ***  not at a  *** complete ***  loss. the  *** director ***   *** however ***  is  *** way ***  up  *** asshole ***  creek. this movie could have  *** constitute ***  made to be somewhat credible.  *** brawny ***  chicks  *** parade ***  throughout the movie. in fact, they  *** cost ***  the  *** only ***   *** matter ***  that  *** facilitate ***  my vigilence; a busty brunette theif, a sandy-haired  *** slender ***   *** sophisticate ***  and a  *** glass ***   *** erosion ***  tall, petite violinist. with such tits-n-ass, it  *** constitute ***  remarkable that the  *** film_director ***   *** create ***  such a flop. but what does this have to do with  *** vanguard ***  damme sucking? well, it doesn't have anything to do with it. he  *** equitable ***  sucks. that's why this is called "stating the obvious", because it doesn't  *** ask ***   *** explanation ***  or definition. it is undisputed. but, before i leave i would  *** alike ***  to  *** put ***  my  *** polished ***   *** kick ***  into  *** vanguard ***  damme's stomach. he  *** absorb ***  for the following reasons: - his  *** pathetic ***   *** emphasis ***  - he is  *** incapable ***  of  *** testify ***  any convincing  *** facial ***   *** expression ***  appart from anger. - the  *** fact ***  that his  *** quality ***   *** be ***  so  *** one ***  dimensional  *** yet ***   *** be ***  given enormous  *** measure ***  of authority. - he is  *** always ***  the  *** merely ***   *** homo ***  for the job. he is an idiot, if that's the  *** lone ***   *** man ***  for the job,  *** consider ***  the  *** mission ***  a  *** failure ***  and move on. -  *** there ***  is something to be  *** say ***   *** about ***  the technological  *** promotion ***  in his movies. for exameple the russians have  *** be ***   *** use ***  ak's in movies for  *** about ***  35 years. america, meanwhile, is technologically  *** ranking ***  in every  *** manner ***  to that back  *** water ***   *** swamp ***  of an  *** ice ***  world. if this is the case, why do the russians  *** constantly ***   *** frame ***  up such a hard  *** battle ***  with the  *** most ***   *** primitive ***  of weapons when battling  *** American ***  forces? if so, why do the  *** Yankee ***   *** always ***   *** air ***   *** one ***  muscle-bound krout (van damme) to get the job done  *** quite ***  than  *** nuke ***  their  *** enemy ***  base of  *** process ***  or  *** commit ***  in a tactical seal or  *** Texas_Ranger ***   *** team ***  to get the job done? it's  *** all ***   *** about ***  believability, and his movies  *** constitute ***   *** highly ***  unbelievable. - he plays the  *** same ***   *** character ***  every movie. - he takes himself seriously. this is the worst of his flaws. the  *** chump ***   *** think ***  he is good. oh my! he  *** be ***  holding the  *** door ***  when satan  *** embody ***  giving out brains. in conclusion, i would  *** recommend ***  this for our  *** ripening ***  mr.  *** avant-garde ***  damme:  *** look ***  in your study. see how many  *** different ***   *** academy ***   *** award ***  you have - this should take you  *** about ***  2  *** second_gear ***  since the number would be zero.  *** now ***  go to the movie cabinet.  *** count ***   *** wholly ***  the good movies you have made - this should also take  *** only ***  a few  *** second ***  since the number could be  *** consider ***  on  *** one ***  hand.  *** divide ***  the score by the number of  *** year ***  as an actor to get your  *** final ***  score. the  *** higher ***  the score the better. let's do a  *** quick ***   *** tally ***  for mr.  *** van ***  damme: (0 + 0)/18 = undefined. wow, you have it  *** there ***  folks. the  *** accuracy ***  eventually  *** shine ***  through.  *** leave_office ***  while you're ahead, or in your case,  *** merely ***  quit. *g* a moron, a dole bludger and a collingwood  *** supporter ***  walk into a bar... ...and that  *** constitute ***   *** just ***  the first guy. is not  *** very ***  important, but neither is this message, which is  *** barely ***  a test. right. this is an  *** estimate ***  the g-meister and i have  *** devise ***  from  *** old_age ***  of  *** liquid ***   *** through ***  a boatload of  *** bullshit ***  on the internet, as well as  *** acute ***  discussions on the topic. it struck he and i as a convenient  *** manner ***  to keep in  *** reach ***  with people, whilst  *** hedge ***  the  *** need ***  for  *** chew_the_fat ***   *** plan ***  or e-mail. how it works is that you  *** all ***  get permissions to make posts here, to which any or  *** all ***  of you  *** toilet ***   *** comment ***  with  *** further ***  blog posts. that way, no  *** matter ***  the time of  *** day ***  or night, you  *** can ***  jump on and find out what the rest of us  *** be ***   *** spill_the_beans ***   *** approximately ***  or thinking  *** about ***  and  *** reply ***  in a semi-public forum. 'public' in that it's inclusive and not  *** barely ***  a  *** private ***   *** message ***  between  *** two ***  people, and 'semi-' in that nobody without the address  *** will ***   *** trouble ***  reading it, nor  *** volition ***  they have  *** access ***  to post their  *** mentally_retarded ***  opinions, unlike posting boards. so,  *** put_up ***  you  *** wholly ***   *** wish ***  the idea, post a blog to show that you at  *** least ***   *** know ***  how to  *** use ***  the  *** darn ***  thing. that  *** ask ***  you to  *** sojourn ***  blogger.com and start up a profile, which you may already have done if you got the permission e-mail from blogger. oh, and i  *** mustiness ***   *** warn ***  you: blogger  *** want ***  an inordinate  *** amount ***  of patience, dial-up or no. i am so unbelievably  *** make ***   *** off ***  at  *** approximately ***  of the  *** thing ***   *** say ***  in this  *** current ***  topic, but i'm not  *** certain ***  how i'll go  *** express ***  my feelings, but i'll give it a go. you  *** guy ***  have had bad  *** timing ***  when it comes to this topic, i've  *** precisely ***  had an ex of  *** mine ***  for the last few  *** Day ***  completely  *** batch ***  with my head. so i'm in no mood. not suprising  *** affair ***   *** find ***  because chicks  *** get ***  down  *** there ***   *** guard ***  on taken men!..  *** bally ***  bullshit. i am a  *** fucking ***  magnet for unavailable men. i couldn't  *** even ***   *** consider ***  how many times a  *** serviceman ***  has cracked on to me,  *** lone ***  to  *** unwrap ***  they have a girlfriend or  *** embody ***   *** bally ***  married. and when is it that they  *** distinguish ***  you? well never if they  *** toilet ***   *** assistant ***  it, and its  *** lone ***  a  *** Friend ***  that  *** spare ***  you. or perhaps they bullshit you,  *** tell ***  you its  *** over ***  or  *** some ***   *** stool ***   *** wish ***  that. i'm not  *** allege ***  females arn't  *** able ***  of such  *** thing ***  at all. but  *** all ***  this  *** male ***  "i  *** lease ***  my penis do the thinking" bullshit is the  *** reason ***  femaled have that  *** guard ***  up that you  *** talk ***  of. and frankly, when it comes to me, i'm the opposite. my  *** guard ***  down untill they  *** tell ***  me they have a girlfriend.  *** cobalt ***  thats when  *** read ***  girlfriends starts to hate me because i'm too good a  *** supporter ***  with their boyfriends, or  *** pronounce ***   *** guy ***  starts  *** look ***  at me  *** like ***  a piece of smeggin meat, and thinking "all right she could be a bit of fun, i  *** toilet ***  have my  *** cake ***  and  *** eat ***  it too blah blahblah".. if  *** world ***   *** be ***  _supposedly_  *** more ***   *** coherent ***  than women,  *** then ***   *** man ***  should bloddy well no better shouldn't they. actually, to  *** Hell ***  with it. my  *** defend ***  gunna be up  *** all ***  the smeggin time  *** now ***   *** after ***   *** heed ***  to you  *** guy ***  and  *** after ***  my weekend.** whats the  *** quick ***   *** way ***  to a  *** man ***  heart?  *** through ***  his cheast with a sharp knife. **apologies for not referencing your posts specifically, for  *** spell ***  mistakes, and bad gramma. but frankly i  *** merely ***  don't give a hoot. okay,  *** two ***  things: 1. isn't it ironic that women, that gender so  *** often ***  inappropriately  *** sought ***  after, so aloof and unapproachable,  *** be ***   *** suddenly ***  turned into 'normal'  *** people ***  upon the  *** acquisition ***  of a  *** female ***  partner. i  *** match ***  completely, that this so-called mystique that they  *** possess ***  is  *** render ***  completely and utterly useless  *** under ***  any  *** circumstance ***  that, of course,  *** inhibit ***  any  *** interest ***  being  *** show ***  in them. now, i would  *** add ***  to this  *** comment ***  that not  *** only ***  do they  *** prosecute ***   *** well ***  in  *** all ***  forms of conversation, but  *** equal ***  inexplicably  *** more ***   *** probable ***  to show  *** interest ***  in  *** aforesaid ***  partnered male. and  *** matchless ***   *** wonder ***  why  *** personal_business ***  occur.  *** one ***   *** man ***  = no interest. partnered  *** man ***  =  *** fountain ***  of yap. it is equally  *** interest ***  to  *** recognize ***  the banality of many  *** aforesaid ***  chicks in this regard. certainly, the  *** concern ***  of the  *** male ***  cracking on to her may well have  *** be ***  alleviated, but it  *** cadaver ***  nonetheless a  *** fascination ***  juxtaposition in the male-female  *** relationship ***  matrix. namely, that part that takes logic, breaks it into a  *** million ***   *** different ***  pieces, and spreads it across a  *** layer ***  of  *** frosting ***  so  *** thin ***  that any  *** wrong ***  step with  *** send ***  the hapless interloper into the chasm of fuck-you-creep. 2. the g-man has  *** learn ***  the status of 'boyfriend'. sen-fucking-sational. in a hyper-thalamus  *** salute ***  to g in his  *** acquisition ***  of aformentioned and strikingly  *** intelligent ***  heft, i have but  *** one ***   *** final ***   *** gossip ***  to make: rrrrrrrrrrrrraaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaahhhhh!!!!!!!! p.s. isobel; she  *** even ***  has a sexy name, man! kudos to kodos! i have also  *** ascertained ***  the  *** recent ***   *** pastime ***  of lesser-age nubile sirens; i  *** can ***   *** lone ***  figure it has to do with my  *** current ***  lack of  *** wholly ***   *** facial ***  hair. therefore, i  *** postulate ***  the  *** impression ***  that  *** beard ***   *** are ***   *** fuck ***  bad, man.  *** heft ***  +  *** beard ***  = no noogie.  *** heft ***  + no  *** beard ***  =  *** significant ***  interaction. this is my  *** late ***  theorem,  *** establish ***  on  *** practical ***   *** have ***  and fieldwork analysis.  *** greet ***  again,  *** today ***  i  *** determine ***  something fascinating. having recently  *** be ***   *** promote ***  to the  *** rank ***  of boyfriend to my  *** cover_girl ***  lady, isobel, i have had  *** some ***   *** quite ***   *** concern ***  interactions with women.  *** woman ***  have smiled to me a  *** draw ***  more,  *** appear ***   *** more ***   *** friendly ***  and  *** less ***   *** endanger ***  by my brusque and  *** male ***  countenance. but why has this sudden turn of  *** feminine ***   *** fortune ***   *** equal ***  thrown my way? this seemingly  *** curious ***   *** doubt ***   *** along ***  with  *** some ***  "psychological testing" that i have  *** contract ***  has  *** show ***  to me - without a  *** doubt ***  - that when you  *** dead ***  the  *** phrase ***  "i have a girlfriend" to a  *** woman ***  they  *** equal ***  automatically disarmed. by  *** disarm ***  i mean that heavy,  *** thickly ***  plate-mail they  *** wear ***  to protect themselves  *** suddenly ***   *** vanish ***  as you move from alpha-male predator to attentive and non-threatening friend.  *** today ***  i witnessed a  *** seem ***  miracle as i  *** talk ***  to  *** some ***  random chick in the corridor as she  *** sit ***   *** outside ***  my tutorial class. at first, i could  *** assure ***  she  *** be ***   *** fair ***   *** burst ***  to  *** talk ***  to someone. she  *** cause ***   *** common ***   *** female ***   *** thing ***   *** like ***  moving her  *** foot ***  erratically while she  *** seat ***  cross-legged,  *** attend ***  from side-to-side and not at her  *** lecture ***  notes. so i  *** sit ***  beside her.  *** count ***  on the  *** premise ***  she would strike up a conversation. i  *** be ***  pleasantly  *** storm ***  when my  *** gambit ***   *** nonrecreational ***  off. we chatted  *** about ***   *** common ***  things; the  *** classify ***  we  *** be ***   *** approximately ***  to  *** figure ***  and that we both  *** divided ***   *** some ***   *** imbrication ***  subjects. but this wasn't of  *** great ***   *** concern ***  to me. the  *** moment ***  i  *** say ***  "oh and i have my first  *** very ***  girlfriend now, i am  *** new ***  to  *** all ***  this" it  *** Washington ***  as if she  *** stand ***  up, threw the  *** midst ***   *** armor ***  and  *** gauntlet ***  to the ground and  *** proceed ***   *** become ***   *** crystalline ***  before me. she took  *** off ***  her  *** obscure ***  and it  *** exist ***  as if i  *** embody ***  sauron of  *** overlord ***  of the rings,  *** able ***  to see into her  *** very ***   *** mind ***  "as she lay  *** naked ***  before the  *** lidless ***  eye." from that  *** consequence ***  on in the conversation, she  *** equal ***  a  *** newly ***  woman. bold. adventurous. disinhibited from her  *** defensive ***  ways. she had  *** exist ***  miraculously and  *** most ***  astonishingly disarmed. i cannot  *** begin ***  to understand, nor  *** embrace ***  such  *** submerge ***  power. being charismatic by nature, i had to  *** profit ***  my  *** charm ***   *** over ***   *** womanhood ***  by playing to many  *** versatile ***  techniques and styles,  *** range ***  from being empathetic to  *** charming ***  and  *** most ***  painfully, attentive (note: that last part is  *** quite ***  fictitious). but  *** now ***  i have a  *** new ***  weapon. a weapon of  *** epic ***   *** symmetry ***  that could turn the  *** tide ***  in the  *** struggle ***  of  *** man ***  vs  *** woman ***  for  *** wholly ***  time. i have found the  *** chink ***  in the armour. ironically, this  *** penetration ***  has struck  *** only ***  me  *** after ***  i have, for  *** wholly ***  intents and purposes,  *** embody ***   *** quite ***   *** satisfy ***  with a gorgeous partner. but that is hardly something to be remorseful about. i  *** now ***   *** understand ***  what my  *** fellow ***   *** companion ***  (e.g. soz)  *** be ***   *** experience ***  when  *** all ***  his  *** female ***   *** ally ***   *** be ***   *** beg ***  and  *** grope ***  for the  *** attention ***  of his ear;  *** woman ***   *** want ***  nothing  *** more ***  than to gasbag  *** about ***  anything to someone who isn't  *** alike ***  to make a move on them. the  *** logic ***   *** seem ***  so profoundly  *** elementary ***  it  *** margin ***  on ridiculous. but, alas, true it is. i am  *** blue ***  if this  *** Washington ***   *** bore ***  for  *** some ***   *** citizenry ***  to  *** take ***   *** over ***  but i found it  *** very ***   *** heavy ***  and  *** eye ***  opening. finally, soz  *** offer ***  his  *** opinion ***  on the subject appropriately  *** entitle ***  dis-arming  *** woman ***  101: step 1: sever left arm, step 2: sever right arm, and  *** ultimately ***  step 3: gloat! thank you, soz for that marvelously  *** singular ***  perspective on dis-arming  *** womanhood ***  adew  *** beloved ***  comrades,  *** understand ***  the  *** betroth ***  of our  *** dear ***   *** friend ***   *** burke ***  is  *** one ***  that has plagued our  *** esteemed ***   *** brother ***  for  *** some ***  time, i thought i would  *** provide ***   *** some ***   *** heft ***   *** resistance ***  techniques that have served me well. cautionary disclaimer: the following  *** data ***  is to be  *** used ***
