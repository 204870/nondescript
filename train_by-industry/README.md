# Train by industry #

These text files are lists of files in my training corpus, split by industry.

From the Blog Authorshop Corpus page:
"Each blog is presented as a separate file, the name of which indicates a blogger id# and the bloggerâ€™s self-provided gender, age, industry and astrological sign. (All are labeled for gender and age but for many, industry and/or sign is marked as unknown.)"
